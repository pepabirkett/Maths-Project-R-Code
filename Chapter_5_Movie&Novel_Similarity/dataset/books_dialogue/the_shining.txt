 sounds of the Overlook Hotel
Top floor,
The attic. Absolutely nothing up there now
 but bric-a-brac. The Overlook has changed hands several times since World War II
 and it seems that each successive manager has put everything they don't want up
 in the attic. I want rattraps and poison bait sowed around in it. Some of the
 third-floor chambermaids say they have heard rustling noises. I don't believe
 it, not for a moment, but there mustn't even be that one-in-a-hundred chance
 that a single rat inhabits the Overlook Hotel.
Of course you wouldn't allow your son up in the attic under any
 circumstances.
No,
The Overlook has one hundred and ten guest quarters,
Thirty of them, all suites, are here on the third floor. Ten in the west
 wing (including the Presidential Suite), ten in the center, ten more in the east
 wing. All of them command magnificent views.
Forty rooms,
thirty doubles and ten singles. And on the first
 floor, twenty of each. Plus three linen closets on each floor, and a storeroom
 which is at the extreme east end of the hotel on the second floor and the
 extreme west end on the first. Questions?
Now. Lobby level: Here in the center is the registration desk. Behind it are
 the offices. The lobby runs for eighty feet in either direction from the desk.
 Over here in the west wing is the Overlook Dining Room and the Colorado Lounge.
 The banquet and ballroom facility is in the east wing. Questions?

  Ullman frowned but went on regardless. "It proved too much for Mr. Watson, and
 he sold the hotel in 1915. It was sold again in 1922, in 1929, in 1936. It stood
 vacant until the end of World War II, when it was purchased and completely
 renovated by Horace Derwent, millionaire inventor, pilot, film producer, and
 entrepreneur."
  "I know the name," Jack said.
  "Yes. Everything he touched seemed to turn to gold . . . except the Overlook.

 hedge animals out front, what next? A life-sized Uncle Wiggly game behind the
 equipment shed? He was getting very tired of Mr. Stuart Ullman, but he could see
 that Ullman wasn't done. Ullman was going to have his say, every last word of
 it.
  
In 1970, Mr. Shockley and a group of his associates bought the hotel and
 turned its management over to me. We have also run in the red for several years,
 but I'm happy to say that the trust of the present owners in me has never
 wavered. Last year we broke even. And this year the Overlook's accounts were
 written in black ink for the first time in almost seven decades.
s pride was justified, and then his
 original dislike washed over him again in a wave.
  He said: "I see no connection between the Overlook
m wrong for the post, Mr. Ullman."
  "One reason that the Overlook has lost so much money lies in the depreciation
 that occurs each winter. It shortens the profit margin a great deal more than
 you might believe, Mr. Torrance. The winters are fantastically cruel. In order
 to cope with the problem, I
t get a
 foothold. To be constantly alert to any and every contingency. During our first
 winter I hired a family instead of a single man. There was a tragedy. A horrible
 tragedy."
  Ullman looked at Jack coolly and appraisingly.
  "I made a mistake. I admit it freely. The man was a drunk."
  Jack felt a slow, hot grin--the total antithesis of the toothy PR grin-
stretch across his mouth. "Is that it? I
t tell you. I

  
t believe I need
 to be any more specific than that. But I do happen to believe that Grady

  
s not really true, is it? There are telephones here, and probably a
 citizen

  
t know about that," Ullman said. "The hotel does have a two-way
 radio that Mr. Watson will show you, along with a list of the correct
 frequencies to broadcast on if you need help. The telephone lines between here
 and Sidewinder are still aboveground, and they go down almost every winter at
 some point or other and are apt to stay down for three weeks to a month and a
 half. There is a snowmobile in the equipment shed also."
  "Then the place really isn

  Mr. Ullman looked pained. 

  Jack saw the point. A snowmobile running at top speed could get you down to
 Sidewinder in an hour and a half . . . maybe. A helicopter from the Parks Rescue
 Service could get up here in three hours . . . under optimum conditions. In a
 blizzard it would never even be able to lift off and you couldn't hope to run a
 snowmobile at top speed, even if you dared take a seriously injured person out
 into temperatures that might be twenty-five below-or forty-five below, if you
 added in the wind chill factor.
  
 Ullman said, 
I suspect that what happened came as a result of too much cheap whiskey, of
 which Grady had laid in a generous supply, unbeknownst to me, and a curious
 condition which the old-timers call cabin fever. Do you know the term?
It's a slang term for the claustrophobic reaction that can occur when people
 are shut in together over long periods of time. The feeling of claustrophobia is
 externalized as dislike for the people you happen to be shut in with. In extreme
 cases it can result in hallucinations and violence--murder has been done over
 such minor things as a burned meal or an argument about whose turn it is to do
 the dishes.
I suspect you did make a mistake at that. Did he hurt them?
He killed them, Mr. Torrance, and then committed suicide. He murdered the
 little girls with a hatchet, his wife with a shotgun, and himself the same way.
 His leg was broken. Undoubtedly so drunk he fell downstairs.
Was he a high school graduate?
As a matter of fact, he wasn't,
I thought a,
 shall we say, less imaginative individual would be less susceptible to the
 rigors, the loneliness--
That was your mistake,
A stupid man is more prone to cabin fever
 just as he's more prone to shoot someone over a card game or commit a spur-of
the-moment robbery. He gets bored. When the snow comes, there's nothing to do
 but watch TV or play solitaire and cheat when he can't get all the aces out.
 Nothing to do but bitch at his wife and nag at the kids and drink. It gets hard
 to sleep because there's nothing to hear. So he drinks himself to sleep and
 wakes up with a hangover. He gets edgy. And maybe the telephone goes out and the
 TV aerial blows down and there's nothing to do but think and cheat at solitaire
 and get edgier and edgier. Finally. . . boom, boom, boom.
Whereas a more educated man, such as yourself?
My wife and I both like to read. I have a play to work on, as Al Shockley
 probably told you. Danny has his puzzles, his coloring books, and his crystal
 radio. I plan to teach him to read, and I also want to teach him to snowshoe.
 Wendy would like to learn how, too. Oh yes, I think we can keep busy and out of
 each other's hair if the TV goes on the fritz.
And Al was telling
 the truth when he told you I no longer drink. I did once, and it got to be
 serious. But I haven't had so much as a glass of beer in the last fourteen
 months. I don't intend to bring any alcohol up here, and I don't think there
 will be an opportunity to get arty after the snow flies.
In that you would be quite correct,
But as long as the three
 of you are up here, the potential for problems is multiplied. I have told Mr.
 Shockley this, and he told me he would take the responsibility. Now I've told
 you, and apparently you are also willing to take the responsibility--
I am.
All right. I'll accept that, since I have little choice. But I would still
 rather have an unattached college boy taking a year off. Well, perhaps you'll
 do. Now I'll turn you over to Mr. Watson, who will take you through the basement
 and around the grounds. Unless you have further questions?
No. None at all.
I hope there are no hard feelings, Mr. Torrance. There is
 nothing personal in the things I have said to you. I only want what's best for
 the Overlook. It is a great hotel. I want it to stay that way.
No. No hard feelings.
t offer to shake hands. There were hard feelings. All kinds of them.

  She looked out the kitchen window and saw him just sitting there on the curb,
 not playing with his trucks or the wagon or even the balsa glider that had
 pleased him so much all the last week since Jack had brought it home. He was
 just sitting there, watching for their shopworn VW, his elbows planted on his
 thighs and his chin propped in his hands, a five-yearold kid waiting for his
 daddy.
  Wendy suddenly felt bad, almost crying bad.
  She hung the dish towel over the bar by the sink and went downstairs,
 buttoning the top two buttons of her house dress. Jack and his pride! Hey no,
 Al, I don
m okay for a while. The hallway walls were gouged
 and marked with crayons, grease pencil, spray paint. The stairs were steep and
 splintery. The whole building smelled of sour age, and what sort of place was

 above them on the third floor weren

 their constant, rancorous fighting did. It scared her. The guy up there was Tom,

 Night Fights, Jack called them, but it wasn
Don't, Tom. Please don't. Please don't.

Hi, Mom.
Want me to see what I can do with that, honey?
No. Dad will fix it.
Your daddy may not be back until suppertime, doc. It's a long drive up into
 those mountains.
Do you think the bug will break down?
No, I don't think so.
Dad said it might,
He
 said the fuel pump was all shot to shit.
Don't say that, Danny.
Fuel pump?
No, `All shot to shit.' Don't say that.
Why?
It's vulgar.
What's vulgar, Mom?
Like when you pick your nose at the table or pee with the bathroom door open.
 Or saying things like `All shot to shit.' Shit is a vulgar word. Nice people
 don't say it.
Dad says it. When he was looking at the bugmotor be said, `Christ this fuel
 pump's all shot to sbit.' Isn't Dad nice?
He's nice, but he's also a grown-up. And he's very careful not to say things
 like that in front of people who wouldn't understand.
You mean like Uncle AI?
Yes, that's right.
Can I say it when I'm grown-up?
I suppose you will, whether I like it or not.
How old?
How does twenty sound, doc?
That's a long time to have to wait.
I guess it is, but will you try?
Hokay.

Mommy, why did Daddy lose his job?
Your daddy was coaching the debate team, Danny. Do you remember that?
Sure,
Arguments for fun, right?
Right.
There was a boy named George Hatfield that Daddy had to cut from the team.
 That means he wasn't as good as some of the others. George said your daddy cut
 him because he didn't like him and not because he wasn't good enough. Then
 George did a bad thing. I think you know about that.
Was he the one who put the holes in our bug's tires?
Yes, he was. It was after school and your daddy caught him doing it.
Your daddy . . . sometimes he does things he's sorry for later. Sometimes he
 doesn't think the way he should. That doesn't happen very often, but sometimes
 it does.
Did he hurt George Hatfield like the time I spilled all his papers?
s sorry for later.
  Wendy blinked her eyes savagely hard, driving her tears all the way back.
  "Something like that, honey. Your daddy hit George to make him stop cutting
 the tires and George hit his head. Then the men who are in charge of the school
 said that George couldn
t teach there
 anymore." She stopped, out of words, and waited in dread for the deluge of
 questions.
  "Oh," Danny said, and went back to looking up the street. Apparently the
 subject was closed. If only it could be closed that easily for her-

  She went back to him and kissed him, rumpled his lightcolored hair that was
 just losing its baby-fineness. He was such a solemn little boy, and sometimes
 she wondered just how he was supposed to survive with her and Jack for parents.
 The high hopes they had begun with came down to this unpleasant apartment
 building in a city they didn't know. The image of Danny in his cast rose up
 before her again. Somebody in the Divine Placement Service had made a mistake,
 one she sometimes feared could never be corrected and which only the most
 innocent bystander could pay for.
  
 she said, and hugged him tight.
  

  She went upstairs and into the kitchen. She put on the teapot and laid a
 couple of Oreos on a plate for Danny in case he decided to come up while she was
 lying down. Sitting at the table with her big pottery cup in front of her, she
 looked out the window at him, still sitting on the curb in his bluejeans and his
 over-sized dark green Stovington Prep sweatshirt, the glider now lying beside
 him. The tears which had threatened all day now came in a cloudburst and she
 leaned into the fragrant, curling steam of the tea and wept. In grief and loss
 for the past, and terror of the future.

s reason. It had seemed slow subjectively, inside his head, but it
 must have all happened in less than a minute. It only seemed slow the way some
 dreams seem slow. The bad ones. Every door and drawer in his study seemed to
 have been ransacked in the time he had been gone. Closet, cupboards, the sliding
 bookcase. Every desk drawer yanked out to the stop. His manuscript, the three
act play he had been slowly developing from a novelette he had written seven
 years ago as an under-graduate, was scattered all over the floor. He had been
 drinking a beer and doing the Act II corrections when Wendy said the phone was
 for him, and Danny had poured the can of beer all over the pages. Probably to
 see it foam. See it foam, see it foam, the words played over and over in his
 mind like a single sick chord on an out-of-tune piano, completing the circuit of
 his rage. He stepped deliberately toward his threeyear-old son, who was looking
 up at him with that pleased grin, his pleasure at the job of work so
 successfully and recently completed in Daddy
s hand and bent it to make him
 drop the typewriter eraser and the mechanical pencil he was clenching in it.
 Danny had cried out a little . . . no . . . no . . . tell the truth . . . he
 screamed. It was all hard to remember through the fog of anger, the sick single
 thump of that one Spike Jones chord. Wendy somewhere, asking what was wrong. Her
 voice faint, damped by the inner mist. This was between the two of them. He had
 whirled Danny around to spank him, his big adult fingers digging into the scant
 meat of the boy

 color until it was like cheese, seeing his eyes, always large, grow larger

 it all back, to find a way around that not too loud sound of bone cracking and

  "The boiler," Watson announced. He pulled a red and blue bandanna from his
 back pocket, blew his nose with a decisive honk, and thrust it back out of sight
 after a short peek into it to see if he had gotten anything interesting.
  The boiler stood on four cement blocks, a long and cylindrical metal tank,
 copper-jacketed and often patched. It squatted beneath a confusion of pipes and
 ducts which zigzagged upward into the high, cobweb-festooned basement ceiling.

 Jack Torrance looked back over his shoulder once into the impenetrable, musty
smelling darkness and thought that if there was ever a place that should have
 ghosts, this was it. He thought of Grady, locked in by the soft, implacable
 snow, going quietly berserk and committing his atrocity. Did they scream? he
 wondered. Poor Grady, feeling it close in on him more every day, and knowing at
 last that for him spring would never come. He shouldn't have been here. And he
 shouldn't have lost his temper.
  As he followed Watson through the door, the words echoed back to him like a
 knell, accompanied by a sharp snap-like a breaking pencil lead. Dear God, he
 could use a drink. Or a thousand of them.

  Danny weakened and went up for his milk and cookies at quarter past four. He
 gobbled them while looking out the window, then went in to kiss his mother, who
 was lying down. She suggested that he stay in and watch 
--the
 time would pass faster--but he shook his head firmly and went back to his place
 on the curb.
  Now it was five o'clock, and although he didn't have a watch and couldn't tell
 time too well yet anyway, he was aware of passing time by the lengthening of the
 shadows, and by the golden cast that now tinged the afternoon light.
  Turning the glider over in his hands, he sang under his breath:

  They had sung that song all together at the Jack and Jill Nursery School he
 had gone to back in Stovington. He didn

 about that, worried that it was adding to his loneliness (and even more deeply,
 unspoken between them, that Danny blamed them), but he didn

 punished him for messing the papers up in his study and the doctor had to put
 his arm in a cast. That memory was already faded, but the memory of the DIVORCE
 thoughts was clear and terrifying. It had mostly been around his mommy that
 time, and he had been in constant terror that she would pluck the word from her
 brain and drag it out of her mouth, making it real. DIVORCE. It was a constant
 undercurrent in their thoughts, one of the few he could always pick up, like the
 beat of simple music. But like a beat, the central thought formed only the spine
 of more complex thoughts, thoughts he could not as yet even begin to interpret.

 Thing until his brain would be quiet and leave him alone.
  But this afternoon his mother had no need to worry and he wished he could go
 to her and tell her that. The bug had not broken down. Daddy was not off
 somewhere doing the Bad Thing. He was almost home now, put-putting along the
 highway between Lyons and Boulder. For the moment his daddy wasn
t there. Once, not long after they put the
 cast on his arm, this had happened at the supper table. They weren
t eat. The thought of eating with all that black
 DIVORCE around made him want to throw up. And because it had seemed desperately
 important, he had thrown himself fully into concentration and something had
 happened. When he came back to real things, he was lying on the floor with beans
 and mashed potatoes in his lap and his mommy was holding him and crying and
 Daddy had been on the phone. He had been frightened, had tried to explain to
 them that there was nothing wrong. that this sometimes happened to him when he
 concentrated on understanding more than what normallv came to him. He tried to
 explain about Tony, who they called his "invisible playmate."
  His father had said: "He

  After the doctor left, Mommy had made him promise to never do that again, to
 never scare them that way, and Danny had agreed. He was frightened himself.
 Because when he bad concentrated his mind, it had flown out to his daddy, and
 for just a moment, before Tony had appeared (far away, as be always did, calling
 distantly) and the strange things had blotted out their kitchen and the carved
 roast on the blue plate, for just a moment his own consciousness had plunged
 through his daddy's darkness to an incomprehensible word much more frightening
 than DIVORCE, and that word was SUICIDE. Danny had never come across it again in
 his daddy's mind, and he had certainly not gone looking for it. He didn't care
 if he never found out exactly what that word meant.
  But he did like to concentrate, because sometimes Tony would come. Not every
 time. Sometimes things just got woozy and swimmy for a minute and then cleared-
most times, in fact--but at other times Tony would appear at the very limit of
 his vision, calling distantly and beckoning . . .
  It had happened twice since they moved to Boulder, and he remembered how
 surprised and pleased he had been to find Tony had followed him all the way from
 Vermont. So all his friends hadn't been left behind after all.
  The first time he had been out in the back yard and nothing much had happened.
 Just Tony beckoning and then darkness and a few minutes later he had come back
 to real things with a few vague fragments of memory, like a jumbled dream. The

 second time, two weeks ago, had been more interesting. Tony, beckoning, calling
 from four yards over: 
 It seemed that he was getting
 up, then falling into a deep hole, like Alice into Wonderland. Then he had been
 in the basement of the apartment house and Tony had been beside him, pointing
 into the shadows at the trunk his daddy carried all his important papers in,

 Right under the stairs. The movers put it right . . . under. . . the stairs."
  Danny had stepped forward to look more closely at this marvel and then he was
 falling again, this time out of the back-yard swing, where he had been sitting
 all along. He had gotten the wind knocked out of himself, too.
  Three or four days later his daddy had been stomping around, telling Mommy
 furiously that he had been all over the goddam basement and the trunk wasn

 said, if Danny fell down the stairs and broke his . . . his leg. Danny told his
 father earnestly that he hadn

  "Then bow did you know, doc?" Daddy asked.
  "Tony showed me."
  His mother and father had exchanged a look over his head. This had happened
 before, from time to time. Because it was frightening, they swept it quickly
 from their minds. But be knew they worried about Tony, Mommy especially, and he
 was careful about thinking the way that could make Tony come where she might
 see. But now he thought she was lying down, not moving about in the kitchen yet,
 and so he concentrated hard to see if he could understand what Daddy was
 thinking about.
  His brow furrowed and his slightly grimy hands clenched into tight fists on
 his jeans. He did not close his eyes-that wasn

  Danny sighed quietly and his body slumped on the curb as if all the muscles
 had gone out of it. He was fully conscious; he saw the street and the girl and
 boy walking up the sidewalk on the other side, holding hands because they were
  (?in love?)
  so happy about the day and themselves together in the day. He saw autumn
 leaves blowing along the gutter, yellow cartwheels of irregular shape. He saw
 the house they were passing and noticed how the roof was covered with

 terror floated into the dark hollows of his body like light brown spores that
 would die in sunlight.
  They faded. Now he was in a room filled with strange furniture, a room that
 was dark. Snow spattered against the windows like thrown sand. His mouth was
 dry, his eyes like hot marbles, his heart triphammering in his chest. Outside
 there was a hollow booming noise, like a dreadful door being thrown wide.
 Footfalls. Across the room was a mirror, and deep down in its silver bubble a
 single word appeared in green fire and that word was: REDRUM.
  The room faded. Another room. He knew
  (would know)
  this one. An overturned chair. A broken window with snow swirling in; already
 it had frosted the edge of the rug. The drapes had been pulled free and hung on
 their broken rod at an angle. A low cabinet lying on its face.
  More hollow booming noises, steady, rhythmic, horrible. Smashing glass.
 Approaching destruction. A hoarse voice, the voice of a madman, made the more
 terrible by its familiarity:
  Come out! Came out, you little shit! Take your medicine!
  Crash. Crash. Crash. Splintering wood. A bellow of rage and satisfaction.
 REDRUM. Coming.
  Drifting across the room. Pictures torn off the walls. A record player
  (?Mommy
!)
  overturned on the floor. Her records, Grieg, Handel, the Beatles, Art
 Garfunkel, Bach, Liszt, thrown everywhere. Broken into jagged black pie wedges.
 A shaft of light coming from another room, the bathroom, harsh white light and a
 word flickering on and off in the medicine cabinet mirror like a red eye,
 REDRUM, REDRUM, REDRUM-
  "No," he whispered. "No, Tony please--"
  And, dangling over the white porcelain lip of the bathtub, a hand. Limp. A
 slow trickle of blood (REDRUM) trickling down one of the fingers, the third,
 dripping onto the tile from the carefully shaped nail-
  No oh no oh no-
  (oh please, Tony, you

s battered red bug was
 turning the corner and chattering up the street, farting blue smoke behind it.
 Danny was off the curb in a second, waving, jiving from one foot to the other,
 yelling: "Daddy! Hey, Dad! Hi! Hi!"
  His daddy swung the VW into the curb, killed the engine, and opened the door.
 Danny ran toward him and then froze, his eyes widening. His heart crawled up
 into the middle of his throat and froze solid. Beside his daddy, in the other
 front seat, was a short-handled mallet, its head clotted with blood and hair.
  Then it was just a bag of groceries.

 Jack said, and ruffled his hair.
 

  Then they were walking up to the door and Mommy had come down to the porch to
 meet them and he stood on the second step and watched them kiss. They were glad
 to see each other. Love came out of them the way love had come out of the boy
 and girl walking up the street and holding hands. Danny was glad.
  The bag of groceries--just a bag of groceries--crackled in his arms.
 Everything was all right. Daddy was home. Mommy was loving him. There were no
 bad things. And not everything Tony showed him always happened.
  But fear had settled around his heart, deep and dreadful, around his heart and
 around that indecipherable word he had seen in his spirit's mirror.

  Jack parked the VW in front of the Rexall in the Table Mesa shopping center
 and let the engine die. He wondered again if he shouldn't go ahead and get the
 fuel pump replaced, and told himself again that they couldn't afford it. If the
 little car could keep running until November, it could retire with full honors
 anyway. By November the snow up there in the mountains would be higher than the

  Wendy had insisted on a phone in spite of their unraveling finances. She had
 argued that with a small child--especially a boy like Danny, who sometimes
 suffered from fainting spells--they couldn't afford not to have one. So Jack had
 forked over the thirty-dollar installation fee, bad enough, and a ninety-dollar
 security deposit, which really hurt. And so far the phone had been mute except
 for two wrong numbers.

  As Jack got out, Danny opened the bug's glovebox and took out the five
 battered gas station maps: Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, New Mexico. He
 loved road maps, loved to trace where the roads went with his finger. As far as
 he was concerned, new maps were the best part of moving West.
  Jack went to the drugstore counter, got Danny's candy bar, and newspaper, and
 a copy of the October Writer's Digest. He gave the girl a five and asked for his
 change in quarters. With the silver in his hand he walked over to the telephone
 booth by the keymaking machine and slipped inside. From here he could see Danny
 in the bug through three sets of glass. The boy's head was bent studiously over
 his maps. Jack felt a wave of nearly desperate love for the boy. The emotion
 showed on his face as a stony grimness.
  He supposed he could have made his obligatory thank-you call to Al from home;
 he certainly wasn't going to say anything Wendy would object to. It was his
 pride that said no. These days he almost always listened to what his pride told
 him to do, because along with his wife and son, six hundred dollars in a
 checking account, and one weary 1968 Volkswagen, his pride was all that was
 left. The only thing that was his. Even the checking account was joint. A year
 ago he had been teaching English in one of the finest prep schools in New
 England. There had been friends--although not exactly the same ones he'd had
 before going on the wagon--some laughs, fellow faculty members who admired his
 deft touch in the classroom and his private dedication to writing. Things had
 been very good six months ago. All at once there was enough money left over at
 the end of each two-week pay period to start a little savings account. In his
 drinking days there had never been a penny left over, even though Al Shockley
 had stood a great many of the rounds. He and Wendy had begun to talk cautiously
 about finding a house and making a down payment in a year or so. A farmhouse in
 the country, take six or eight years to renovate it completely, what the hell,
 they were young, they had time.
  Then he had lost his temper.
  George Hatfield.
  The smell of hope had turned to the smell of old leather in Crommert's office,
 the whole thing like some scene from his own play: the old prints of previous
 Stovington headmasters on the walls, steel engravings of the school as it had
 been in 1879, when it was first built, and in 1895, when Vanderbilt money had
 enabled them to build the field house that still stood at the west end of the
 soccer field, squat, immense, dressed in ivy. April ivy had been rustling
 outside Crommert's slit window and the drowsy sound of steam heat came from the
 radiator. It was no set, he remembered thinking. It was real. His life. How
 could he have fucked it up so badly?
  

  The Board wanted lack's resignation and Jack had given it to them. Under
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (29 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:52 PM

 different circumstances, he would have gotten tenure that June.
  What had followed that interview in Crommert's office had been the darkest,
 most dreadful night of his life. The wanting, the needing to get drunk had never
 been so bad. His hands shook. He knocked things over. And he kept wanting to
 take it out on Wendy and Danny. His temper was like a vicious animal on a frayed
 leash. He had left the house in terror that he might strike them. Had ended up
 outside a bar, and the only thing that had kept him from going in was the
 knowledge that if he did, Wendy would leave him at last, and take Danny with
 her. He would be dead from the day they left.
  Instead of going into the bar, where dark shadows sat sampling the tasty
 waters of oblivion, he had gone to Al Shockley's house. The Board's vote had
 been six to one. Al had been the one.
  Now he dialed the operator and she told him that for a dollar eighty-five he
 could be put in touch with Al two thousand miles away for three minutes. Time is
 relative, baby, he thought, and stuck in eight quarters. Faintly he could hear
 the electronic boops and beeps of his connection sniffing its way eastward.
  Al's father had been Arthur Longley Shockley, the steel baron. He had left his
 only son, Albert, a fortune and a huge range of investments and directorships
 and chairs on various boards. One of these had been on the Board of Directors
 for Stovington Preparatory Academy, the old man's favorite charity. Both Arthur
 and Albert Shockley were alumni and Al lived in Barre, close enough to take a
 personal interest in the school's affairs. For several years Al had been
 Stovington's tennis coach.
  Jack and Al had become friends in a completely natural and uncoincidental way:
 at the many school and faculty functions they attended together, they were
 always the two drunkest people there. Shockley was separated from his wife, and
 Jack's own marriage was skidding slowly downhill, although he still loved Wendy
 and had promised sincerely (and frequently) to reform, for her sake and for baby
 Danny's.
  The two of them went on from many faculty parties, hitting the bars until they
 closed, then stopping at some mom 'n' pot) store for a case of beer they would
 drink parked at the end of some back road. There were mornings when Jack would
 stumble into their leased house with dawn seeping into the sky and find Wendy
 and the baby asleep on the couch, Danny always on the inside, a tiny fist curled
 under the shelf of Wendy's jaw. He would look at them and the self-loathing
 would back up his throat in a bitter wave, even stronger than the taste of beer
 and cigarettes and martinis--martians, as Al called them. Those were the times
 that his mind would turn thoughtfully and sanely to the gun or the rope or the
 razor blade.
  If the bender had occurred on a weeknight, he would sleep for three hours, get
 up, dress, chew four Excedrins, and go off to teach his nine o'clock American
 Poets still drunk. Good morning, kids, today the Red-Eyed Wonder is going to
 tell you about how Longfellow lost his wife in the big fire.

  He hadn't believed he was an alcoholic, Jack thought as Al's telephone began
 ringing in his ear. The classes he had missed or taught unshaven, still reeking
 of last night's martians. Not me, I can stop anytime. The nights he and Wendy
 had passed in separate beds. Listen, I'm fine. Mashed fenders. Sure I'm okay to
 drive. The tears she always shed in the bathroom. Cautious looks from his
 colleagues at any party where alcohol was served, even wine. The slowly dawning
 realization that he was being talked about. The knowledge that he was producing
 nothing at his Underwood but balls of mostly blank paper that ended up in the
 wastebasket. He had been something of a catch for Stovington, a slowly blooming
 American writer perhaps, and certainly a man well qualified to teach that great
 mystery, creative writing. He had published two dozen short stories. He was
 working on a play, and thought there might be a novel incubating in some mental
 back room. But now he was not producing and his teaching had become erratic.
  It had finally ended one night less than a month after Jack had broken his
 son's arm. That, it seemed to him, had ended his marriage. All that remained was
 for Wendy to gather her will . . . if her mother hadn't been such a grade A
 bitch, he knew, Wendy would have taken a bus back to New Hampshire as soon as
 Danny had been okay to travel. It was over.
  It had been a little past midnight. Jack and Al were coming into Barre on U.S.
 31, Al behind the wheel of his Jag, shifting fancily on the curves, sometimes
 crossing the double yellow line. They were both very drunk; the martians had
 landed that night in force. They came around the last curve before the bridge at
 seventy, and there was a kid's bike in the road, and then the sharp, hurt
 squealing as rubber shredded from the Jag's tires, and Jack remembered seeing
 Al's face looming over the steering wheel like a round white moon. Then the
 jingling crashing sound as they hit the bike at forty, and it had flown up like
 a bent and twisted bird, the handlebars striking the windshield, and then it was
 in the air again, leaving the starred safety glass in front of Jack's bulging
 eyes. A moment later he heard the final dreadful smash as it landed on the road
 behind them. Something thumped underneath them as the tires passed over it. The
 Jag drifted around broadside, Al still jockeying the wheel, and from far away
 Jack heard himself saying: 

  In his ear the phone kept ringing. Come on, Al. Be home. Let me get this over
 with.
  Al had brought the car to a smoking halt not more than three feet from a
 bridge stanchion. Two of the Jag's tires were flat. They had left zigzagging
 loops of burned rubber for a hundred and thirty feet. They looked at each other
 for a moment and then ran back in the cold darkness.
  The bike was completely ruined. One wheel was gone, and looking back over his
 shoulder Al had seen it lying in the middle of the road, half a dozen spokes
 sticking up like piano wire. Al had said hesitantly:

 over, Tacky-boy."
  "Then where

  Jack frowned. It had all happened with such crazy speed. Coming around the
 corner. The bike looming in the Jag's headlights. Al yelling something. Then the
 collision and the long skid.
  They moved the bike to one shoulder of the road. Al went back to the Jag and
 put on its four-way flashers. For the next two hours they searched the sides of
 the road, using a powerful four-cell flashlight. Nothing. Although it was late,
 several cars passed the beached Jaguar and the two men with the bobbing
 flashlight. None of them stopped. Jack thought later that some queer providence,
 bent on giving them both a last chance, had kept the cops away, had kept any of
 the passersby from calling them.
  At quarter past two they returned to the Jag, sober but queasy. 
 Al demanded. 
t parked on the side; it was right in the fucking middle!"
  Jack could only shake his head.
  "Your party does not answer," the operator said. "Would you like me to keep on
 trying?"
  "A couple more rings, operator. Do you mind?"
  "No, sir," the voice said dutifully.
  Come on, Al!
  Al had hiked across the bridge to the nearest pay phone, called a bachelor
 friend and told him it would be worth fifty dollars if the friend would get the

  And now, sweating in this phonebootb, it occurred to lack that he had never
 doubted Al's ability to carry through. He had driven back to his own house in
 the VW with the radio turned up, and some disco group chanted over and over
 again, talismanic in the house before dawn: Do it anyway . . . you wanta do it .
 . . do it anyway you want . . . No matter how loud he heard the squealing tires,
 the crash. When he blinked his eyes shut, he saw that single crushed wheel with
 its broken spokes pointing at the sky.
  When he got in, Wendy was asleep on the couch. He looked in Danny's room and

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 Danny was in his crib on his back, sleeping deeply, his arm still buried in the
 cast. In the softly filtered glow from the streetlight outside he could see the
 dark lines on its plastered whiteness where all the doctors and nurses in
 pediatrics had signed it.
  It was an accident. He fell down the stairs.
  (o you dirty liar)
  It was an accident. l lost my temper.
  (you fucking drunken waste god wiped snot out of his nose and that was you)
  Listen, hey, come on, please, just an accident-
  But the last plea was driven away by the image of that bobbing flashlight as
 they hunted through the dry late November weeds, looking for the sprawled body
 that by all good rights should have been there, waiting for the police. It
 didn't matter that Al had been driving. There had been other nights when he had
 been driving.
  He pulled the covers up over Danny, went into their bedroom, and took the
 Spanish Llama .38 down from the top shelf of the closet. It was in a shoe box.
 He sat on the bed with it for nearly an hour, looking at it, fascinated by its
 deadly shine.
  It was dawn when he put it back in the box and put the box back in the closet.
  That morning he had called Bruckner, the department head, and told him to
 please post his classes. He had the flu. Bruckner agreed, with less good grace
 than was common. Jack Torrance had been extremely susceptible to the flu in the
 last year.
  Wendy made him scrambled eggs and coffee. They ate in silence. The only sound
 came from the back yard, where Danny was gleefully running his trucks across the
 sand pile with his good hand.
  She went to do the dishes. Her back to him, she said:

  "Have you?" He lit a cigarette with trembling hands. No hangover this morning,
 oddly enough. Only the shakes. He blinked. In the instant
I want to talk to you about . . . about what's best for me and Danny. For you

Would you do something for me?
Would you do me a favor?
What?
Let's talk about it a week from today. If you still want to..,
  Now she turned to him, her hands lacy with suds, her pretty face pale and
 disillusioned.

  She stopped, looking in his eyes, fascinated, suddenly uncertain.
  "In a week," he said. His voice had lost all its strength and dropped to a
 whisper. "Please. I
ll talk. About anything you want."
  They looked across the sunny kitchen at each other for a long time, and when
 she turned back to the dishes without saying anything more, he began to shudder.
 God, he needed a drink. Just a little pick-me-up to put things in their true
 perspective-
  "Danny said he dreamed you had a car accident," she said abruptly. "He has
 funny dreams sometimes. He said it this morning, when I got him dressed. Did
 you, Jack? Did you have an accident?"
  "No."
  By noon the craving for a drink had become a low-grade fever. He went to Al

  A week passed. He and Wendy didn

 ever hated anyone-and when he came home she would swear she smelled scotch or
 gin on his breath, but he would talk lucidly to her before supper, drink coffee,
 play with Danny after supper, sharing a Coke with him, read him a bedtime story,
 then sit and correct themes with cup after cup of black coffee by his hand, and
 she would have to admit to herself that she had been wrong.
  Weeks passed and the unspoken word retreated further from the back of her
 lips. Jack sensed its retirement but knew it would never retire completely.
 Things began to get a little easier. Then George Hatfield. He had lost his
 temper again, this time stone sober.
  "Sir, your party still doesn

 He hung up, closed his eyes in the hot booth, and again
 saw the crashing bike, the bobbing flashlight. There had been a squib in the
 paper the next day, no more than a space-filler really, but the owner had not
 been named. Why it had been out there in the night would always be a mystery to
 them, and perhaps that was as it should be.
  He went back out to the car and gave Danny his slightly melted Baby Ruth.
  

  

  Danny hesitated, looking at his father's abstracted face.
  

  

  But it was no good. Daddy's mind was someplace else, not with him. Thinking
 about the Bad Thing again.
  (I dreamed that you hurt me, Daddy)
  

  
 Danny said as they pulled out into the parking lot. He put the maps
 back into the glove compartment.
  

  

  Jack gave his son a faint, troubled glance; and then his mind turned to his
 play.

                                NIGHT THOUGHTS
  Love was over, and her man was sleeping beside her.
  Her man.
  She smiled a little in the darkness, his seed still trickling with slow warmth
 from between her slightly parted thighs, and her smile was both rueful and
 pleased, because the phrase her man summoned up a hundred feelings. Each feeling
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (35 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 examined alone was a bewilderment. Together, in this darkness floating to sleep,
 they were like a distant blues tune heard in an almost deserted night club,
 melancholy but pleasing.
    Lovin' you baby, is just like rollin' off a log,
    But if I can't be your woman, I sure ain't goin' to be your dog.
  Had that been Billie Holiday? Or someone more prosaic like Peggy Lee? Didn't
 matter. It was low and torchy, and in the silence of her head it played
 mellowly, as if issuing from one of those old-fashioned jukeboxes, a Wurlitzer,
 perhaps, half an hour before closing.
  Now, moving away from her consciousness, she wondered how many beds she had
 slept in with this man beside her. They had met in college and had first made
 love in his apartment . . . that had been less than three months after her
 mother drove her from the house, told her never to come back, that if she wanted
 to go somewhere she could go to her father since she had been responsible for
 the divorce. That bad been in 1970. So long ago? A semester later they had moved
 in together, had found jobs for the summer, and had kept the apartment when
 their senior year began. She remembered that bed the most clearly, a big double
 that sagged in the middle. When they made love, the rusty box spring had counted
 the beats. That fall she had finally managed to break from her mother. Jack had
 helped her. She wants to keep beating you, Jack had said. The more times you
 phone her, the more times you crawl back begging forgiveness, the more she can
 beat you with your father. It's good for her, Wendy, because she can go on
 making believe it was your fault. But it's not good for you. They had talked it
 over again and again in that bed, that year.
  (Jack sitting up with the covers pooled around his waist, a cigarette burning
 between his fingers, looking her in the eye--he had a half-humorous, half
scowling way of doing that--telling her: She told you never to come back, right?
 Never to darken her door again, right? Then why doesn't she hang up the phone
 when she knows it's you? Why does she only tell you that you can't come in if
 I'm with you? Because she thinks I might cramp her style a little bit. She wants
 to keep putting the thumbscrews right to you, baby. You're a fool if you keep
 letting her do it. She told you never to come back, so why don't you take her at
 her word? Give it a rest. And at last she'd seen it his way.)
  It had been Jack's idea to separate for a while--to get perspective on the
 relationship, he said. She had been afraid he had become interested in someone
 else. Later she found it wasn't so. They were together again in the spring and
 he asked her if she had been to see her father. She had jumped as if he'd struck
 her with a quirt.
  How did you know that?
  The Shadow knows.
  Have you been spying on me?
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (36 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  And his impatient laughter, which had always made her feel so awkward--as if
 she were eight and he was able to see her motivations more clearly than she.
  You needed time, Wendy.
  For what?
  I guess . . . to see which one of us you wanted to marry.
  Jack, what are you saying?
  I think I'm proposing marriage.
  The wedding. Her father had been there, her mother had not been. She
 discovered she could live with that, if she had Jack. Then Danny had come, her
 fine son.
  That had been the best year, the best bed. After Danny was born, Jack had
 gotten her a job typing for half a dozen English Department profs--quizzes,
 exams, class syllabi, study notes, reading lists. She ended up tvping a novel
 for one of them, a novel that never got published . . . much to Jack's very
 irreverent and very private glee. The job was good for forty a week, and
 skyrocketed all the way up to sixty during the two months she spent typing the
 unsuccessful novel. They had their first car, a five-year-old Buick with a baby
 seat in the middle. Bright, upwardly mobile young marrieds. Danny forced a
 reconciliation between her and her mother, a reconciliation that was always
 tense and never happy, but a reconciliation all the same. When she took Danny to
 the house, she went without Jack. And she didn't tell Jack that her mother
 always remade Danny's diapers, frowned over his formula, could always spot the
 accusatory first signs of a rash on the baby's bottom or privates. Her mother
 never said anything overtly, but the message came through anyway: the price she
 had begun to pay (and maybe always would) for the reconciliation was the feeling
 that she was an inadequate mother. It was her mother's way of keeping the
 thumbscrews handy.
  During the days Wendy would stay home and housewife, feeding Danny his bottles
 in the sunwashed kitchen of the four-room second-story apartment, playing her
 records on the battered portable stereo she had had since high school. Jack
 would come home at three (or at two if he felt he could cut his last class), and
 while Danny slept he would lead her into the bedroom and fears of inadequacy
 would be erased.
  At night while she typed, he would do his writing and his assignments. In
 those days she sometimes came out of the bedroom where the typewriter was to
 find both of them asleep on the studio couch, Jack wearing nothing but his
 underpants, Danny sprawled comfortably on her husband's chest with his thumb in
 his mouth. She would put Danny in his crib, then read whatever Jack had written
 that night before waking him up enough to come to bed.
  The best bed, the best year.
                 Sun gonna shine in my backyard someday . . .

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  In those days, Jack's drinking had still been well in hand. On Saturday nights
 a bunch of his fellow students would drop over and there would be a case of beer
 and discussions in which she seldom took part because her field had been
 sociology and his was English: arguments over whether Pepys's diaries were
 literature or history; discussions of Charles Olson's poetry; sometimes the
 reading of works in progress. Those and a hundred others. No, a thousand. She
 felt no real urge to take part; it was enough to sit in her rocking chair beside
 Jack, who sat cross-legged on the floor, one hand holding a beer, the other
 gently cupping her calf or braceleting her ankle.
  The competition at UNH had been fierce, and Jack carried an extra burden in
 his writing. He put in at least an hour at it every night. It was his routine.
 The Saturday sessions were necessary therapy. They let something out of him that
 might otherwise have swelled and swelled until he burst.
  At the end of his grad work he had landed the job at Stovington, mostly on the
 strength of his stories--four of them published at that time, one of them in
 Esquire. She remembered that day clearly enough; it would take more than three
 years to forget it. She had almost thrown the envelope away, thinking it was a
 subscription offer. Opening it, she had found instead that it was a letter
 saying that Esquire would like to use Jack's story 

 early the following year. They would pay nine hundred dollars, not on
 publication but on acceptance. That was nearly half a year's take typing papers
 and she had flown to the telephone, leaving Danny in his high chair to goggle
 comically after her, his face lathered with creamed peas and beef puree.
  Jack had arrived from the university forty-five minutes later, the Buick
 weighted down with seven friends and a keg of beer. After a ceremonial toast
 (Wendy also had a glass, although she ordinarily had no taste for beer), Jack
 had signed the acceptance letter, put it in the return envelope, and went down
 the block to drop it in the letter box. When he came back he stood gravely in
 the door and said, 
 There were cheers and applause. When the
 keg was empty at eleven that night, Jack and the only two others who were still
 ambulatory went on to hit a few bars.
  She had gotten him aside in the downstairs hallway. The other two were already
 out in the car, drunkenly singing the New Hampshire fight song. Jack was down on
 one knee, owlishly fumbling with the lacings of his moccasins.

s snores came floating out to the living room.
 That had been the first night she had slept on the couch.
  Now she turned restlessly on the bed, already dozing. Her mind, freed of any
 linear order by encroaching sleep, floated past the first year at Stovington,
 past the steadily worsening times that had reached low ebb when her husband had
 broken Danny

 belong in the decision. Neither did her feelings of guilt over their marriage
 nor her feelings of inadequacy over her own. It was necessary for her son
s arm. He was going to lose his job, if
 not this year then the year after. Already she had noticed the sympathetic looks
 from the other faculty wives. She told herself that she had stuck with the messy
 job of her marriage for as long as she could. Now she would have to leave it.
 Jack could have full visitation rights, and she would want support from him only
 until she could find something and get on her feet--and that would have to be
 fairly rapidly because she didn

 unpleasantness.
  "I want to talk to you about something that might be best for Danny and I. For
 you too, maybe. We should have talked about it before, I guess."
  And then he had said an odd thing. She had expected to discover his anger, to
 provoke the bitterness, the recriminations. She had expected a mad dash for the
 liquor cabinet. But not this soft, almost toneless reply that was so unlike him.
 It was almost as though the Jack she had lived with for six years had never come
 back last night--as if he had been replaced by some unearthly doppelganger that
 she would never know or be quite sure of.
  "Would you do something for me? A favor?"
  "What?" She had to discipline her voice strictly to keep it from trembling.
  "Let

  And she had agreed. It remained unspoken between them. During that week he had
 seen Al Shockley more than ever, but he came home early and there was no liquor
 on his breath. She imagined she smelled it, but knew it wasn't so. Another week.
 And another.
  Divorce went back to committee, unvoted on.
  What had happened? She still wondered and still had not the slightest idea.
 The subject was taboo between them. He was like a man who had leaned around a
 corner and had seen an unexpected monster lying in wait, crouching among the
 dried bones of its old kills. The liquor remained in the cabinet, but he didn't
 touch it. She had considered throwing them out a dozen times but in the end
 always backed away from the idea, as if some unknown charm would be broken by
 the act.
  And there was Danny's part in it to consider.
  If she felt she didn't know her husband, then she was in awe of her child--awe
 in the strict meaning of that word: a kind of undefined superstitious dread.
  Dozing lightly, the image of the instant of his birth was presented to her.
 She was again lying on the delivery table, bathed in sweat, her hair in strings,
 her feet splayed out in the stirrups
  (and a little high from the gas they kept giving her whiffs of; at one point
 she had muttered that she felt like an advertisement for gang rape, and the
 nurse, an old bird who had assisted at the births of enough children to populate
 a high school, found that extremely funny)
  the doctor between her legs, the nurse off to one side, arranging instruments
 and humming. The sharp, glassy pains had been coming at steadily shortening
 intervals, and several times she had screamed in spite of her shame.
  Then the doctor told her quite sternly that she must PUSH, and she did, and
 then she felt something being taken from her. It was a clear and distinct
 feeling, one she would never forget-the thing taken. Then the doctor held her
 son up by the legs-she had seen his tiny sex and known he was a boy immediately
and as the doctor groped for the airmask, she had seen something else, something
 so horrible that she found the strength to scream again after she had thought

 all screams were used up:
  He has no face!
  But of course there had been a face, Danny's own sweet face, and the caul that
 had covered it at birth now resided in a small jar which she had kept, almost
 shamefully. She did not hold with old superstition, but she had kept the caul
 nevertheless. She did not hold with wives' tales, but the boy had been unusual
 from the first. She did not believe in second sight but-
  Did Daddy have an accident? I dreamed Daddy had an accident.
  Something had changed him. She didn't believe it was just her getting ready to
 ask for a divorce that had done it. Something had happened before that morning.
 Something that had happened while she slept uneasily. Al Shockley said that
 nothing had happened, nothing at all, but he had averted his eyes when he said
 it, and if you believed faculty gossip, Al had also climbed aboard the fabled
 wagon.
  Did Daddy have an accident?
  Maybe a chance collision with fate, surely nothing much more concrete. She had
 read that day's paper and the next day's with a closer eye than usual, but she
 saw nothing she could connect with Jack. God help her, she had been looking for
 a hit-and-run accident or a barroom brawl that had resulted in serious injuries
 or . . . who knew? Who wanted to? But no policeman came to call, either to ask
 questions or with a warrant empowering him to take paint scrapings from the WV's
 bumpers. Nothing. Only her husband's one hundred and eighty degree change and
 her son's sleepy question on waking:
  Did Daddy have an accident? I dreamed . . .
  She had stuck with Jack more for Danny's sake than she would admit in her
 waking hours, but now, sleeping lightly, she could admit it: Danny had been
 Jack's for the asking, almost from the first. Just as she had been her father's,
 almost from the first. She couldn't remember Danny ever spitting a bottle back
 on Jack's shirt. Jack could get him to eat after she had given up in disgust,
 even when Danny was teething and it gave him visible pain to chew. When Danny
 had a stomachache, she would rock him for an hour before he began to quiet; Jack
 had only to pick him up, walk twice around the room with him, and Danny would be
 asleep on lack's shoulder, his thumb securely corked in his mouth.
  He hadn't minded changing diapers, even those he called the special
 deliveries. He sat with Danny for hours on end, bouncing him on his lap, playing
 finger games with him, making faces at him while Danny poked at his nose and
 then collapsed with the giggles. He made formulas and administered them
 faultlessly, getting up every last burp afterward. He would take Danny with him
 in the car to get the paper or a bottle of milk or nails at the hardware store
 even when their son was still an infant. He had taken Danny to a Stovington
Keene soccer match when Danny was only six months old, and Danny had sat
 motionlessly on his father's lap through the whole game, wrapped in a blanket, a
 small Stovington pennant clutched in one chubby fist.

  He loved his mother but he was his father's boy.
  And hadn't she felt, time and time again, her son's wordless opposition to the
 whole idea of divorce? She would be thinking about it in the kitchen, turning it
 over in her mind as she turned the potatoes for supper over in her hands for the
 peeler's blade. And she would turn around to see him sitting cross-legged in a
 kitchen chair, looking at her with eyes that seemed both frightened and
 accusatory. Walking with him in the park, he would suddenly seize both her hands
 and say--almost demand: 
 And, confused, she
 would nod or say, 
 Then he would run to the duck pond,
 sending them squawking and scared to the other end, flapping their wings in a
 panic before the small ferocity of his charge, leaving her to stare after him
 and wonder.
  There were even times when it seemed that her determination to at least
 discuss the matter with Jack dissolved, not out of her own weakness, but under
 the determination of her son's will.
  I don't believe such things.
  But in sleep she did believe them, and in sleep, with her husband's seed still
 drying on her thighs, she felt that the three of them had been permanently
 welded together--that if their three/oneness was to be destroyed, it would not
 be destroyed by any of them but from outside.
  Most of what she believed centered around her love for Jack. She had never
 stopped loving him, except maybe for that dark period immediately following
 Danny's 
 And she loved her son. Most of all she loved them together,
 walking or riding or only sitting, Jack's large head and Danny's small one
 poised alertly over the fans of old maid hands, sharing a bottle of Coke,
 looking at the funnies. She loved having them with her, and she hoped to dear
 God that this hotel caretaking job Al had gotten for Jack would be the beginning
 of good times again.
                       And the wind gonna rise up, baby,
                       and blow my blues away . . .
  Soft and sweet and mellow, the song came back and lingered, following her down
 into a deeper sleep where thought ceased and the faces that came in dreams went
 unremembered.

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  Danny awoke with the booming still loud in his ears, and the drunk, savagely
 pettish voice crying hoarsely: Come out here and take your medicine! I'll find
 you! I'll find youl
  But now the booming was only his racing heart, and the only voice in the night
 was the faraway sound of a police siren.
  He lay in bed motionlessly, looking up at the wind-stirred shadows of the
 leaves on his bedroom ceiling. They twined sinuously together, making shapes
 like the vines and creepers in a jungle, like patterns woven into the nap of a
 thick carpet. He was clad in Doctor Denton pajamas, but between the pajama suit
 and his skin he had grown a more closely fitting singlet of perspiration.
  
 he whispered. 

  No answer.
  He slipped out of bed and padded silently across to the window and looked out
 on Arapahoe Street, now still and silent. It was two in the morning. There was
 nothing out there but empty sidewalks drifted with fallen leaves, parked cars,
 and the long-necked streetlight on the corner across from the Cliff Brice gas
 station. With its hooded top and motionless stance, the streetlight looked like
 a monster in a space show.
  He looked up the street both ways, straining his eyes for Tony's slight,
 beckoning form, but there was no one there.
  The wind sighed through the trees, and the fallen leaves rattled up the
 deserted walks and around the hubcaps of parked cars. It was a faint and
 sorrowful sound, and the boy thought that he might be the only one in Boulder
 awake enough to hear it. The only human being, at least. There was no way of
 knowing what else might be out in the night, slinking hungrily through the
 shadows, watching and scenting the breeze.
  I'll find you! I'll find you!
  
 he whispered again, but without much hope.
  Only the wind spoke back, gusting more strongly this time, scattering leaves
 across the sloping roof below his window. Some of them slipped into the
 raingutter and came to rest there like tired dancers.
  Danny . . . Danneee . . .
  He started at the sound of that familiar voice and craned out the window, his
 small hands on the sill. With the sound of Tony's voice the whole night seemed
 to have come silently and secretly alive, whispering even when the wind quieted
 again and the leaves were still and the shadows had stopped moving. He thought
 he saw a darker shadow standing by the bus stop a block down, but it was hard to
 tell if it was a real thing or an eye-trick.
  Don't go, Danny . .
  Then the wind gusted again, making him squint, and the shadow by the bus stop
 was gone . . . if it had ever been there at all. He stood by his window for

  (a minute? an hour?)
  some time longer, but there was no more. At last he crept back into his bed
 and pulled the blankets up and watched the shadows thrown by the alien
 streetlight turn into a sinuous jungle filled with flesh-eating plants that
 wanted only to slip around him, squeeze the life out of him, and drag him down
 into a blackness where one sinister word flashed in red:
  REDRUM.

                            A VIEW OF THE OVERLOOK
  Mommy was worried.
  She was afraid the bug wouldn't make it up and down all these mountains and
 that they would get stranded by the side of the road where somebody might come
 ripping along and hit them. Danny himself was more sanguine; if Daddy thought
 the bug would make this one last trip, then probably it would.
  
re just about there," Jack said.
  Wendy brushed her hair back from her temples. "Thank God."
  She was sitting in the right-hand bucket, a Victoria Holt paperback open but
 face down in her lap. She was wearing her blue dress, the one Danny thought was
 her prettiest. It had a sailor collar and made her look very young, like a girl
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (45 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM

 just getting ready to graduate from high school. Daddy kept putting his hand
 high up on her leg and she kept laughing and brushing it off, saying Get away,
 fly.
  Danny was impressed with the mountains. One day Daddy had taken them up in the
 ones near Boulder, the ones they called the Flatirons, but these were much
 bigger, and on the tallest of them you could see a fine dusting of snow, which
 Daddy said was often there year-round.
  And they were actually in the mountains, no goofing around. Sheer rock faces
 rose all around them, so high you could barely see their tops even by craning
 your neck out the window. When they left Boulder, the temperature had been in
 the high seventies. Now, just after noon, the air up here felt crisp and cold
 like November back in Vermont and Daddy had the heater going . . . not that it
 worked all that well. They had passed several signs that said FALLING ROCK ZONE
 (Mommy read each one to him), and although Danny had waited anxiously to see
 some rock fall, none had. At least not yet.
  Half an hour ago they had passed another sign that Daddy said was very
 important. This sign said ENTERING SIDEWINDER PASS, and Daddy said that sign was
 as far as the snowplows went in the wintertime. After that the road got too
 steep. In the winter the road was closed from the little town of Sidewinder,
 which they had gone through just before they got to that sign, all the way to
 Buckland, Utah.
  Now they were passing another sign.
  "What

  

  
 Danny said.
  
 Mommy said, and crossed her fingers. Danny looked down at her
 open-toed sandals and saw that she had crossed her toes as well. He giggled. She
 smiled back, but he knew that she was still worried.
  The road wound up and up in a series of slow S curves, and Jack dropped the
 bug's stick shift from fourth gear to third, then into second. The bug wheezed
 and protested, and Wendy's eye fixed on the speedometer needle, which sank from
 forty to thirty to twenty, where it hovered reluctantly.
  
 she began timidly.
  
 Jack said shortly.
  The rock wall fell away on their right, disclosing a slash valley that seemed
 to go down forever, lined a dark green with Rocky Mountain pine and spruce. The
 pines fell away to gray cliffs of rock that dropped for hundreds of feet before
 smoothing out. She saw a waterfall spilling over one of them, the early
 afternoon sun sparkling in it like a golden fish snared in a blue net. They were
 beautiful mountains but they were hard. She did not think they would forgive
 many mistakes. An unhappy foreboding rose in her throat. Further west in the
 Sierra Nevada the Donner Party had become snowbound and had resorted to
 cannibalism to stay alive. The mountains did not forgive many mistakes.

  With a punch of the clutch and a jerk, Jack shifted down to first gear and
 they labored upward, the bug's engine thumping gamely.

 the road and give the bug a chance to rest." He craned over his shoulder at
 Danny, who was sitting on a pile of blankets. "What do you think, doc? We might
 see some deer. Or caribou."
  "Sure, Dad."
  The VW labored up and up. The speedometer dropped to just above the five-mile
an-hour hashmark and was beginning to hitch when Jack pulled off the road
  ("What
 
 she read dutifully.)
  and stepped on the emergency brake and let the VW run in neutral.
  
 he said, and got out.
  They walked to the guardrail together.

Oh, Jack, it's gorgeous!

 location in America. I don't care much for him, but I think he might be . . .

Maybe it was the sun. The sun got in my eyes.

  Ullman seemed truly warm toward Danny only, but Wendy had experienced that
 before. Danny seemed to be a child for people who ordinarily held W. C. Fields

 Mr. Ullman said.
  They watched him cross the lobby, touch Mrs. Brant's elbow deferentially, and
 spread his hands and nod when she turned her tirade on him. He listened
 sympathetically, nodded again, and said something in return. Mrs. Brant smiled
 triumphantly, turned to the unhappy desk clerk, and said loudly:

  She allowed Ullman, who barely came to the bulky shoulder of her fur coat, to
 take her arm and lead her away, presumably to his inner office.

 she said, and then they laughed again, Wendy putting
 a hand over her mouth. Danny still didn't understand, but it was okay. They were
 loving each other. Danny thought this place reminded her of somewhere else
  (the beak-man place)
  where she had been happy. He wished he liked it as well as she did, but he
 kept telling himself over and over that the things Tony showed him didn't always
 come true. He would be careful. He would watch for something called Redrum. But
 he would not say anything unless he absolutely had to. Because they were happy,
 they had been laughing, and there were no bad thoughts.
  
 Jack said.
  
s gorgeousl Danny, Iookl"
  But Danny didn
t like heights;
 they made him dizzy. Beyond the wide front porch, which ran the length of the
 hotel, a beautifully manicured lawn (there was a putting green on the right)
 sloped away to a long, rectangular swimming pool. A CLOSED sign stood on a
 little tripod at one end of the pool; closed was one sign he could read by
 himself, along with Stop, Exit, Pizza, and a few others.
  Beyond the pool a graveled path wound off through baby pines and spruces and
 aspens. Here was a small sign he didn
What's R-O-Q-U-E, Daddy?
A game,
It's a little bit like croquet, only you play it on a
 gravel court that has sides like a big billiard table instead of grass. It's a
 very old game, Danny. Sometimes they have tournaments here.
Do you play it with a croquet mallet?
Like that,
Only the handle's a little shorter and the head has
 two sides. One side is hard rubber and the other side is wood.
It's pronounced roke,
I'll teach you how to play, if you
 want.
Maybe,
I might not like it; though.
Well if you don't like it, doc, you don't have to play. All right?
Sure.
Do you like the animals?
That's called a topiary.
Those animals were what made Uncle Al think of me for the job,
He knew that when I was in college I used to work for a landscaping
 company. That's a business that fixes people's lawns and bushes and hedges. I
 used to trim a lady's topiary.
Yes, I used to trim her topiary at least once a week
Get away, fly,
Did she have nice hedges, Dad?
They weren't animals, Danny,
They
 were playing cards. Spades and hearts and clubs and diamonds. But the hedges
 grow, you see--
Dad?
They grow, Danny, and
 lose their shape. So I'll have to give them a haircut once or twice a week until
 it gets so cold they stop growing for the year.
And a playground, too,
My lucky boy.
Do you like it, Danny?
I sure do,
It's
 neat.
t know the word isolation, but if someone had explained it to him he
 would have seized on it. Far below, lying in the sun like a long black snake
 that had decided to snooze for a while, was the road that led back through
 Sidewinder Pass and eventually to Boulder. The road that would be closed all
 winter long. He felt a little suffocated at the thought, and almost jumped when
 Daddy dropped his hand on his shoulder.
  "I
re a little busy right
 now."
  "Sure, Dad."
  Mrs. Brant came out of the inner office looking vindicated. A few moments
 later two bellboys, struggling with eight suitcases between them, followed her
 as best they could as she strode triumphantly out the door. Danny watched
 through the window as a man in a gray uniform and a hat like a captain in the
 Army brought her long silver car around to the door and got out. He tipped his
 cap to her and ran around to open the trunk.
  And in one of those flashes that sometimes came, he got a complete thought
 from her, one that floated above the confused, low-pitched babble of emotions

  The man in the gray uniform closed the trunk and walked back to help her into
 the car. Danny watched closely to see if she would say anything about his pants,
 but she only smiled and gave him a dollar bill-a tip. A moment later she was
 guiding the big silver car down the driveway.
  He thought about asking his mother why Mrs. Brant might want the car-man

s side while Jack, wholly out of his element, hung back a little with
 Danny. A long wallboard hung with cutting instruments which went all the way
 from paring knives to twohanded cleavers hung beside a four-basin sink. There
 was a breadboard as big as their Boulder apartment
I think I'll have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs every time I come in,
Don't let it get you down,
It's big, but it's still only a
 kitchen. Most of this stuff you'll never even have to touch. Keep it clean,
 that's all I ask. Here's the stove I'd be using, if I was you. There are three
 of them in all, but this is the smallest.
  Smallest, she thought dismally, looking at it There were twelve burners, two
 regular ovens and a Dutch oven, a heated well on top in which you could simmer
 sauces or bake beans, a broiler, and a warmer--plus a million dials and
 temperature gauges.

  "Yes..:

  "You three folks could eat up here for a year, I guess," Hallorann said. "We
 got a cold-pantry, a walk-in freezer, all sorts of vegetable bins, and two
 refrigerators. Come on and let me show you."
  For the next ten minutes Hallorann opened bins and doors, disclosing food in
 such amounts as Wendy had never seen before. The food supplies amazed her but
 did not reassure her as much as she might have thought: the Donner Party kept
 recurring to her, not with thoughts of cannibalism (with all this food it would
 indeed be a long time before they were reduced to such poor rations as each
 other), but with the reinforced idea that this was indeed a serious business:
 when snow fell, getting out of here would not be a matter of an hour

  she had called the emergency Medix squad, dialing the number from the little
 card attached to the phone. They had been at the house only ten minutes later.
 There were other numbers written on that little card. You could have a police
 car in five minutes and a fire truck in even less time than that, because the
 fire station was only three blocks away and one block over. There was a man to
 call if the lights went out, a man to call if the shower stopped up, a man to
 call if the TV went on the fritz. But what would happen up here if Danny had one
 of his fainting spells and swallowed his tongue?

  What if the place caught on fire? If Jack fell down the elevator shaft and
 fractured his skull? What if--?

  Hallorann showed them into the walk-in freezer first, where their breath
 puffed out like comic strip balloons. In the freezer it was as if winter had
 already come.

 whole chickens hanging from a row of hooks in the wood-planked walls. Canned
 hams stacked up like poker chips, a dozen of them. Below the chickens, ten
 roasts of beef, ten roasts of pork, and a huge leg of lamb.
  "You like lamb, doe?" Hallorann asked, grinning.
  "I love it," Danny said immediately. He had never had it.
  "I knew you did. There
s a noncontentious sort of meat."
  From behind them Jack said curiously: "How did you know we called him doe?"
  Hallorann turned around. "Pardon?"
  "Danny: We call him doe sometimes. Like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons."

  There were more wonders in the cold-pantry. A hundred boxes of dried milk
 (Hallorann advised her gravely to buy fresh milk for the boy in Sidewinder as
 long as it was feasible), five twelve-pound bags of sugar, a gallon jug of
 blackstrap molasses, cereals, glass jugs of rice, macaroni, spaghetti; ranked
 cans of fruit and fruit salad; a bushel of fresh apples that scented the whole
 room with autumn; dried raisins, prunes, and apricots (
 Hallorann said, and pealed laughter at the coldpantry
 ceiling, where one old-fashioned light globe hung down on an iron chain); a deep
 bin filled with potatoes; and smaller caches of tomatoes, onions, turnips,
 squashes, and cabbages.

 her thirty-dollar-a-week grocery budget so stunned her that she was unable to

  "It is sort of a pity," Wendy said.
  "What happened to him? The old man?" Jack asked.

 him," Hallorann said. "Sometime in the early thirties before the Depression

  Hallorann tucked his tongue into his cheek as if feeling for a bit of food in

 what the joke was, except it had something to do with Mr. Ullman, who didn

 long main room was beginning to take on the quiet, deserted look that Jack
 supposed they would become familiar with soon enough. The high-backed chairs
 were empty. The nuns who had been sitting by the fire were gone, and the fire
 itself was down to a bed of comfortably glowing coals. Wendy glanced out into
 the parking lot and saw that all but a dozen cars had disappeared.
  She found herself wishing they could get back in the VW and go back to
 Boulder. . . or anywhere else.

Thank you, Sally.
You have yourself a

 the best. Know you'll have it.
Thanks,
You've been very kind.
I'll take good care of your kitchen,
Enjoy Florida.
I always do,
Last chance, guy. Want to come to Florida?
I guess not,
Okay. Like to give me a hand out to my car with my bags?
If my mommy says I can.
You can,
but you'll have to have that jacket buttoned.

Fine,
Guess you can handle that one, can't you?

This ain't

 keep her in Florida because she's too old for all this mountain climbing. You
 need a hand with that?
No, sir,
Good boy,
You shine on, boy. Harder than anyone I ever met in my life. And I'm sixty
 years old this January.
Huh?
You got a knack,
Me, I've always called it
 shining. That's what my grandmother called it, too. She had it. We used to sit
 in the kitchen when I was a boy no older than you and have long talks without
 even openin our mouths.
Really?

 Wendy kept silent, watching Hallorann
Get you kinda lonely, thinkin you were the
 only one?
Am I the
 only one you ever met?
No, child, no. But you shine the
 hardest.
Are there lots, then?
No,
but you do run across them. A lot of folks, they got a
 little bit of shine to them. They don't oven know it. But they always seem to
 show up with flowers when their wives are feelin blue with the monthlies, they
 do good on school tests they don't even study for, they got a good idea how
 people are feelin as soon as they walk into a room. I come across fifty or sixty
 like that. But maybe only a dozen, countin my gram, that knew they was shinin.
Wow,
Do you know Mrs. Brant?
Her?
She don't shine. Just sends her supper
 back two-three times every night.
I know she doesn't,
But do you know the man in the
 gray uniform that gets the cars?
Mike? Sure, I know Mike. What about him?
Mr. Hallorann, why would she want his pants?
What are you talking about, boy?
Well, when she was watching him, she was thinking she would sure like to get
 into his pants and I just wondered why-
Boy,
you are gonna know everything there
 is to know about the human condition before you make ten. I dunno if to envy you
 or not.
But Mrs. Brant--
You never mind her,
And don't go askin your mom, either. You'd
 only upset her, dig what I'm sayin?
Yes, sir,
That Mrs. Brant is just a dirty old woman with an itch, that's all you have
 to know.
How hard can you hit, doc?
Huh?
Give me a blast. Think at me. I want to know if you got as much as I think
 you do.
What do you want me to think?
Anything. Just think it hard.
Okay,
s raw force-he didn
t hurt him)
  And the thought was:
                               (!!! HI, DICK!!!)
  Hallorann winced and jerked bac  kward on the seat. His teeth came together
 with a hard click, drawing blood from his lower lip in a thin trickle. His hands
 flew up involuntarily from his lap to the level of his chest and then settled
 back again. For a moment his eyelids fluttered limply, with no conscious
 control, and Danny was frightened.
  "Mr. Hallorann? Dick? Are you okay?"
  "I don
 Hallorann said, and laughed weakly.

  "Probably my good luck you did . . . my brains would be leakin out my ears."
 He saw the alarm on Danny
No harm done. What did it feel
 like to you?
Like I was Nolan Ryan throwing a fastball,
You like baseball, do you?

The Red Sox in the American
 League East and the Angels in the West. We saw the Red Sox against Cincinnati in
 the World Series. I was a lot littler then. And Daddy was . . .

  Hallorann was grinning broadly. "I bet he did. Can you do anything else,
 Danny? Is it only thoughts and feelings, or is there more?"
  Cautiously: "Is there more for you?"
  "Sometimes," Hallorann said. "Not often. Sometimes . . . sometimes there are
 dreams. Do you dream, Danny?"
  "Sometimes," Danny said, "I dream when I

 wanted to go into his mouth again. He had never told anyone but Mommy and Daddy
 about Tony. He made his thumb-sucking hand go back into his lap.

  And suddenly Danny had one of those flashes of understanding that frightened
 him most of all; it was like a sudden glimpse of some incomprehensible machine
 that might be safe or might be deadly dangerous. He was too young to know which.
 He was too young to understand.
  "What

For a minute it was like I had just passed out. And then I heard an explosion
 and saw flames. There were people screaming. Sirens. And I heard this hissin
 noise that could only be steam. Then it seemed like I got a little closer to
 whatever it was and I saw a railroad car off the tracks and laying on its side
 with Georgia aced South Carolina Railroad written on it, and I knew like a flash
 that my brother Carl was on that train and it jumped the tracks and Carl was
 dead. Just like that. Then it was gone and here's this scared, stupid little KP
 in front of me, still holdin out that potato and the peeler. He says, 'Are you
 okay, Sarge?' And I says, `No. My brother's just been killed down in Georgia'
 And when I finally got my momma on the overseas telephone, she told me how it
 was.

 toilets to be private. I never did black out, but I started to get this feelin,
 stronger and stronger, that my plane was gonna crash. Then the feeling went
 away, and the smell of oranges, and I knew it was over. I went back to the Delta
 Airlines desk and changed my flight to one three hours later. And do you know
 what happened?"
  "What?" Danny whispered.
  "Nothin!" Hallorann said, and laughed. He was relieved to see the boy smile a
 little, too. "Not one single thingl That old plane landed right on time and

 very excited about that, and had waited, knowing that it took time, but there
 had been no new baby.
  "Now you listen," Hallorann said, and took both of Danny
I've had some bad dreams here, and I've had some bad feelins. I've worked here
 two seasons now and maybe a dozen times I've had . . . well, nightmares. And
 maybe half a dozen times I've thought I've seen things. No, I won't say what. It
 ain't for a little boy like you. Just nasty things. Once it had something to do
 with those damn hedges clipped to look like animals. Another time there was a
 maid, Delores Vickery her name was, and she had a little shine to her, but I
 don't think she knew it. Mr. Ullman fired her . . . do you know what that is,
 doc?
Yes, sir,
my daddy got fired from his teaching job and
 that's why we're in Colorado, I guess.
Well, Ullman fired her on account of her saying she'd seen something in one
 of the rooms where . . . well, where a bad thing happened. That was in Room 217,
 and I want you to promise me you won't go in there, Danny. Not all winter. Steer
 right clear.
All right,
Did the lady--the maiden--did she ask you to go
 look?
Yes, she did. And there was a bad thing there. But . . . I don't think it was
 a bad thing that could hurt anyone, Danny, that's what I'm tryin to say. People
 who shine can sometimes see things that are gonna happen, and I think sometimes
 they can see things that did happen. But they're just like pictures in a book.
 Did you ever see a picture in a book that scared you, Danny?
Yes,

 kissed Hallorann
Your folks, they don't shine, do they?
No, I don't think so.
I tried them like I did you,

 bit. I think all mothers shine a little, you know, at least until their kids
 grow up enough to watch out for themselves. Your dad . . .

I don't think he shines at all,
So you don't worry
 about them. You just take care of you. I don't think there's anything here that
 can hurt you. So just be cool, okay?
Okay.
Danny! Hey, doc!
That's Mom. She wants me. I have to go.
I know you do,
You have a good time here, Danny. Best you
 can, anyway.
I will. Thanks, Mr. Hallorann. I feel a lot better.
Danny?
What?
If there Is trouble . . . you give a call. A big loud holler like the one you
 gave a few minutes ago. I might hear you even way down in Florida. And if I do,
 I'll come on the run.

You take care, big boy.
I will.

s paternity in the gesture; Jack could hardly
 have done it better himself. She would get no more out of Danny. She felt strong
 exasperation mixed with an even stronger love: the love was helpless, the
 exasperation came from a feeling that she was deliberately being excluded. With
 the two of them around she sometimes felt like an outsider, a bit player who had
 accidentally wandered back onstage while the main action was taking place. Well,

  "I thought I would take a few extra minutes and show you through the Hotel,"
 Ullman said, and Wendy reflected that you could always hear that capital H in
 Ullman
I'm sure your husband will get to
 know the ins and outs of the Overlook quite well, Mrs. Torrance, but you and
 your son will doubtless keep more to the lobby level and the first floor, where
 your quarters are.
Doubtless,
It's a beautiful place,
I rather enjoy showing it
 off.

  "Not at all," Ullman said: "The shop is shut. Tout fins, for this season, at
 least. And I plan to overnight in Boulder-at the Boulderado, of course. Only
 decent hotel this side of Denver . . . except for the Overlook itself, of
 course. This way."
  They stepped into the elevator together. It was ornately scrolled in copper
 and brass, but it settled appreciably before Ullman pulled the gate across.
 Danny stirred a little uneasily, and Ullman smiled down at him. Danny tried to
 smile back without notable success.
  "Don
 Ullman said. 

  
 Jack said, looking up at the cut-glass globe in the
 center of the elevator ceiling. Wendy bit the inside of her cheek to keep the
 smile away.
  Ullman was not amused. He slid the inner gate across with a rattle and a bang.

 gasp, which had been mingled with theirs, had nothing to do with beauty.

 corner.

 stepped back into the elevator. Once again the car sank queasily beneath their
 feet. "But I

  They went down to the second floor where there were more rooms and even more
 twists and turns in the corridor. The light from the windows had begun to fade
 appreciably now as the sun went behind the mountains. Mr. Ullman showed them one
 or two rooms and that was all. He walked past 217, the one Dick Hallorann had
 warned him about, without slowing. Danny looked at the bland number-plate on the
 door with uneasy fascination.
  Then down to the first floor. Mr. Ullman didn

  "No kitchen, of course," Ullman said, "but there is a dumb-waiter. This
 apartment is directly over the kitchen." He slid aside a square of paneling and
 disclosed a wide, squarer tray. He gave it a push and it disappeared, trailing
 rope behind it.

 forgetting all fears in favor of that intoxicating shaft behind the wall.

  Mr. Ullman looked over his shoulder, honestly puzzled. "Beg pardon?"
  "The beds," Jack said pleasantly. "We can push them together."
  "Oh, quite," Ullman said, momentarily confused. Then his face cleared and a
 red flush began to creep up from the collar of his shirt. "Whatever you like."
  He led them back into the sitting room, where a second door opened on a second
 bedroom, this one equipped with bunk beds. A radiator clanked in one corner, and
 the rug on the floor was a hideous embroidery of western sage and cactus--Danny

 to flutter the collar of his jacket. "You folks take care now," he said.
  It was Danny who answered. "Yes, sir, we will."

  "Thank you, sir," Danny said. "I hope you do, too."

                                UP ON THE ROOF
  "Oh you goddam fucking son of a bitch!"
  Jack Torrance cried these words out in both surprise and agony as he slapped
 his right hand against his blue chambray workshirt, dislodging the big, slow
moving wasp that had stung him. Then he was scrambling up the roof as fast as he
 could, looking back over his shoulder to see if the wasp
s gently sloping western roof
 and doing the shingling. Jack had admitted freely to Wendy that he could have
 finished the job four days ago, but he felt no real urge to hurry. The view from
 up here was spectacular, even putting the vista from the Presidential Suite in
 the shade. More important, the work itself was soothing. On the roof he felt
 himself healing from the troubled wounds of the last three years. On the roof he
 felt at peace. Those three years began to seem like a turbulent nightmare.

 wasp put an end to cogitation, was coming clearer all the time. He thought he
 could rough it out in two weeks, and have a clean copy of the whole damned play
 by New Year
Casey. She had marketed three of Jack
Casey before sitting down to
 it. She had written again earlier that year asking where the hell was the play?
 He had written back wryly that The Little School had been indefinitely--and
 perhaps infinitely--delayed between hand and page "in that interesting
 intellectual Gobi known as the writer
 Now it looked as if she might
 actually get the play. Whether or not it was any good or if it would ever see
 actual production was another matter. And he didn't seem to care a great deal
 about those things. He felt in a way that the play itself, the whole thing, was
 the roadblock, a colossal symbol of the bad years at Stovington Prep, the
 marriage he had almost totaled like a nutty kid behind the wheel of an old
 jalopy, the monstrous assault on his son, the incident in the parking lot with
 George Hatfield, an incident he could no longer view as just another sudden and
 destructive flare of temper. He now thought that part of his drinking problem
 had stemmed from an unconscious desire to be free of Stovington and the security
 he felt was stifling whatever creative urge he had. He had stopped drinking, but
 the need to be free had been just as great. Hence George Hatfield. Now all that
 remained of those days was the play on the desk in his and Wendy's bedroom, and
 when it was done and sent off to Phyllis's hole-in-the-wall New York agency, he
 could turn to other things. Not a novel, he was not ready to stumble into the
 swamp of another three-year undertaking, but surely more short stories. Perhaps
 a book of them.
  Moving warily, he scrambled back down the slope of the roof on his hands and
 knees past the line of demarcation where the fresh green Bird shingles gave way
 to the section of roof he had just finished clearing. He came to the edge on the
 left of the wasps' nest he had uncovered and moved gingerly toward it, ready to
 backtrack and bolt down his ladder to the ground if things looked too hot.
  He leaned over the section of pulled-out flashing and looked in.
  The nest was in there, tucked into the space between the old flashing and the
 final roof undercoating of three-by-fives. It was a damn big one. The grayish
 paper ball looked to Jack as if it might be nearly two feet through the center.
 Its shape was not perfect because the space between the flashing and the boards
 was too narrow, but he thought the little buggers had still done a pretty
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (79 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 respectable job. The surface of the nest was acrawl with the lumbering, slow
moving insects. They were the big mean ones, not yellow jackets, which are
 smaller and calmer, but wall wasps. They had been rendered sludgy and stupid by
 the fall temperatures, but Jack, who knew about wasps from his childhood,
 counted himself lucky that he had been stung only once. And, he thought, if
 Ullman had hired the job done in the height of summer, the workman who tore up
 that particular section of the flashing would have gotten one hell of a
 surprise. Yes indeedy. When a dozen wall wasps land on you all at once and start
 stinging your face and hands and arms, stinging your legs right through your
 pants, it would be entirely possible to forget you were seventy feet up. You
 might just charge right off the edge of the roof while you were trying to get
 away from them. All from those little things, the biggest of them only half the
 length of a pencil stub.
  He had read someplace--in a Sunday supplement piece or a back-of-the-book
 newsmagazine article--that 7 per cent of all automobile fatalities go
 unexplained. No mechanical failure, no excessive speed, no booze, no bad
 weather. Simply one-car crashes on deserted sections of road, one dead occupant,
 the driver, unable to explain what had happened to him. The article had included
 an interview with a state trooper who theorized that many of these so-called
 
 resulted from insects in the car. Wasps, a bee, possibly even a
 spider or moth. The driver gets panicky, tries to swat it or unroll a window to
 let it out. Possibly the insect stings him. Maybe the driver just loses control.
 Either way it's bang! . , . all over. And the insect, usually completely
 unharmed, would buzz merrily out of the smoking wreck, looking for greener
 pastures. The trooper had been in favor of having pathologists look for insect
 venom while autopsying such victims, Jack recalled.
  Now, looking down into the nest, it seemed to him that it could serve as both
 a workable symbol for what he had been through (and what he had dragged his
 hostages to fortune through) and an omen for a better future. How else could you
 explain the things that had happened to him? For he still felt that the whole
 range of unhappy Stovington experiences had to be looked at with Jack Torrance
 in the passive mode. He had not done things; things had been done to him. He had
 known plenty of people on the Stovington faculty, two of them right in the
 English Department, who were hard drinkers. Zack Tunney was in the habit of
 picking up a full keg of beer on Saturday afternoon, plonking it in a backyard
 snowbank overnight, and then killing damn near all of it on Sunday watching
 football games and old movies. Yet through the week Zack was as sober as a
 judge--a weak cocktail with lunch was an occasion.
  He and Al Shockley had been alcoholics. They had sought each other out like
 two castoffs who were still social enough to prefer drowning together to doing
 it alone. The sea had been whole-grain instead of salt, that was all. Looking
 down at the wasps, as they slowly went about their instinctual business before
 winter closed down to kill all but their hibernating queen, he would go further.
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (80 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 He was still an alcoholic, always would be, perhaps had been since Sophomore
 Class Night in high school when he had taken his first drink. It had nothing to
 do with willpower, or the morality of drinking, or the weakness or strength of
 his own character. There was a broken switch somewhere inside, or a circuit
 breaker that didn't work, and he had been propelled down the chute willynilly,
 slowly at first, then accelerating as Stovington applied its pressures on him. A
 big grease& slide and at the bottom had been a shattered, ownerless bicycle and
 a son with a broken arm. Jack Torrance in the passive mode. And his temper, same
 thing. All his life he had been trying unsuccessfully to control it. He could
 remember himself at seven, spanked by a neighbor lady for playing with matches.
 He had gone out and hurled a rock at a passing car. His father had seen that,
 and he had descended on little Jacky, roaring. He had reddened Jack's behind . .
 . and then blacked his eye. And when his father had gone into the house,
 muttering, to see what was on television, Jack had come upon a stray dog and had
 kicked it into the gutter. There had been two dozen fights in grammar school,
 even more of them in high school, warranting two suspensions and uncounted
 detentions in spite of his good grades. Football had provided a partial safety
 valve, although he remembered perfectly well that he had spent almost every
 minute of every game in a state of high piss-off, taking every opposing block
 and tackle personally. He had been a fine player, making All-Conference in his
 junior and senior years, and he knew perfectly well that he had his own bad
 temper to thank . . . or to blame. He had not enjoyed football. Every game was a
 grudge match.
  And yet, through it all, he hadn't felt like a son of a bitch. He hadn't felt
 mean. He had always regarded himself as Jack Torrance, a really nice guy who was
 just going to have to learn how to cope with his temper someday before it got
 him in trouble. The same way he was going to have to learn how to cope with his
 drinking. But he had been an emotional alcoholic just as surely as he had been a
 physical one-the two of them were no doubt tied together somewhere deep inside
 him, where you'd just as soon not look. But it didn't much matter to him if the
 root causes were interrelated or separate, sociological or psychological or
 physiological. He had had to deal with the results: the spankings, the beatings
 from his old man, the suspensions, with trying to explain the school clothes
 torn in playground brawls, and later the hangovers, the slowly dissolving glue
 of his marriage, the single bicycle wheel with its bent spokes pointing into the
 sky, Danny's broken arm. And George Hatfield, of course.
  He felt that he had unwittingly stuck his hand into The Great Wasps' Nest of
 Life. As an image it stank. As a cameo of reality, he felt it was serviceable.
 He had stuck his hand through some rotted flashing in high summer and that hand
 and his whole arm had been consumed in holy, righteous fire, destroying
 conscious thought, making the concept of civilized behavior obsolete. Could you
 be expected to behave as a thinking human being when your hand was being impaled
 on red-hot darning needles? Could you be expected to live in the love of your
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (81 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 nearest and dearest when the brown, furious cloud rose out of the hole in the
 fabric of things (the fabric you thought was so innocent) and arrowed straight
 at you? Could you be held responsible for your own actions as you ran crazily
 about on the sloping roof seventy feet above the ground, not knowing where you
 were going, not remembering that your panicky, stumbling feet could lead you
 crashing and blundering right over the rain gutter and down to your death on the
 concrete seventy feet below? Jack didn't think you could. When you unwittingly
 stuck your hand into the wasps' nest, you hadn't made a covenant with the devil
 to give up your civilized self with its trappings of love and respect and honor.
 It just happened to you. Passively, with no say, you ceased to be a creature of
 the mind and became a creature of the nerve endings; from college-educated man
 to wailing ape in five easy seconds.
  He thought about George Hatfield.
  Tall and shaggily blond, George had been an almost insolently beautiful boy.
 In his tight faded jeans and Stovington sweatshirt with the sleeves carelessly
 pushed up to the elbows to disclose his tanned forearms, he had reminded Jack of
 a young Robert Redford, and he doubted that George had much trouble scoring--no
 more than that young footballplaying devil Jack Torrance had ten years earlier.
 He could say that he honestly didn't feel jealous of George, or envy him his
 good looks; in fact, he had almost unconsciously begun to visualize George as
 the physical incarnation of his play hero, Gary Benson--the perfect foil for the
 dark, slumped, and aging Denker, who grew to hate Gary so much. But he, Jack
 Torrance, had never felt that way about George. If he had, he would have known
 it. He was quite sure of that.
  George had floated through his classes at Stovington. A soccer and baseball
 star, his academic program had been fairly undemanding and he had been content
 with C's and an occasional B in history or botany. He was a fierce field
 contender but a lackadaisical, amused sort of student in the classrooms Jack was
 familiar with the type, more from his own days as a high school and college
 student than from his teaching experience, which was at second hand. George
 Hatfield was a jock. He could be a calm, undemanding figure in the classroom,
 but when the right set of competitive stimuli was applied (like electrodes to
 the temples of Frankenstein's monster, Jack thought wryly), he could become a
 juggernaut.
  In January, George had tried out with two dozen others for the debate team. He
 had been quite frank with Jack. His father was a corporation lawyer, and he
 wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. George, who felt no burning call to
 do anything else, was willing. His grades were not top end, but this was, after
 all, only prep school and it was still early times. If should be came to must
 be, his father could pull some strings. George's own athletic ability would open
 still other doors. But Brian Hatfield thought his son should get on the debate
 team. It was good practice, and it was something that law-school admissions
 boards always looked for. So George went out for debate, and in late March Jack
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (82 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 cut him from the team.
  The late winter inter-squad debates had fired George Hatfield's competitive
 soul. He became a grimly determined debater, prepping his pro or con position
 fiercely. It didn't matter if the subject was legalization of marijuana,
 reinstating the death penalty, or the oil-depletion allowance. George became
 conversant, and he was just jingoist enough to honestly not care which side he
 was on-a rare and valuable trait', even in high-level debaters, Jack knew. The
 souls of a true carpetbagger and a true debater were not far removed from each
 other; they were both passionately interested in the main chance. So far, so
 good.
  But George Hatfield stuttered.
  This was not a handicap that had even shown up in the classroom, where George
 was always cool and collected (whether he had done his homework or not), and
 certainly not on the Stovington playing fields, where talk was not a virtue and
 they sometimes even threw you out of the game for too much discussion.
  When George got tightly wound up in a debate, the stutter would come out. The
 more eager he became, the worse it was. And when he felt he had an opponent dead
 in his sights, an intellectual sort of buck fever seemed to take place between
 his speech centers and his mouth and he would freeze solid while the clock ran
 out. It was painful to watch.
  

  The buzzer would go off and George would whirl around to stare furiously at
 Jack, who sat beside it. George's face at those moments would be flushed, his
 notes crumpled spasmodically in one hand.
  Jack had held on to George long after he had cut most of the obvious flat
 tires, hoping George would work out. He remembered one late afternoon about a
 week before he had reluctantly dropped the ax. George had stayed after the
 others had filed out, and then had confronted Jack angrily.
  

  Jack looked up from the papers he was putting back into his briefcase.

watching the clock."
  "The clock and the timer may keep slightly different times, George, but I
 never touched the dial on the damned thing. Scout

  

  The belligerent, I'm-sticking-up-for-my-rights way George was looking at him
 had sparked Jack's own temper. He had
  been off the sauce for two months, two months too long, and he was ragged. He
 made one last effort to hold himself in.

 the other members of the squad were embarrassed for George
t set the timer ahead. He was quite sure of it.
  A week later he had cut him, and that time he had kept his temper. The shouts
 and the threats had all been on George
s right front tire. The back tires were already shredded,
 and the bug sat on the fiats like a small, tired dog.
  Jack had seen red, and remembered very little of the encounter that followed.
 He remembered a thick growl that seemed to issue from his own throat: "All
 right, George. If that

  He remembered George looking up, startled and fearful. He had said:

 flat when he got there and he was just cleaning dirt out of the front treads

  Jack had waded in, his fists held up in front of him, and it seemed that he
 had been grinning. But he wasn't sure of that.
  The last thing be remembered was George holding up the knife and saying: 

  And the next thing was Miss Strong, the French teacher, holding Jack's arms,
 crying, screaming: 
re going to kill him!"
  He had blinked around stupidly. There was the hunting knife, glittering
 harmlessly on the parking lot asphalt four yards away. There was his Volkswagen,
 his poor old battered bug, veteran of many wild midnight drunken rides, sitting
 on three fiat shoes. There was a new dent in the right front fender, he saw, and
 there was something in the middle of the dent that was either red paint or
 blood. For a moment he had been confused, his thoughts

 sunny daylight they were easier to disregard.

 Jack she thought was much too ambitious. Their son was intelligent, they knew
 that, but it would be a mistake to push him too far too fast. Jack had agreed.
 There would be no pushing involved. But if the kid caught on fast, they would be
 prepared. And now she wondered if Jack hadn

 neatly made printing. Circle the right picture, the one that went with the word.
 And their son would stare from the word to the pictures, his lips moving,
 sounding out, actually sweating it out, And with his double-sized red pencil
 curled into his pudgy right fist, he could now write about three dozen words on
 his own.
  His finger traced slowly under the words in the reader. Above them was a
 picture Wendy half-remembered from her own grammar school days, nineteen years
 before. A laughing boy with brown curly hair. A girl in a short dress, her hair
 in blond ringlets one hand holding a jump rope. A prancing dog running after a
 large red rubber ball. The first-grade trinity. Dick, Jane, and Jip.
  "See Jip run," Danny read slowly. "Run, Jip, run. Run, run, run." He paused,
 dropping his finger down a line. "See the . . ." He bent closer, his nose almost
 touching the page now. "See the . . ."

  "All right, honey," she said. "But it

  Unheeding, Danny bent forward again. On his face was an expression that might
 be more commonly seen hovering over a graduate record exam in a college gym
 somewhere. She liked it less and less.

  Danny's giggle, fading, then cut off by the firm click of the bathroom door.
 He was private about his bathroom functions, while both she and Jack were pretty
 much catch-as-catch-can. Another sign--and they were multiplying all the time-
that there was another human being in the place, not just a carbon copy of one
 of them or a combination of both. It made her a little sad. Someday her child
 would be a stranger to her, and she would be strange to him . . . but not as
 strange as her own mother had become to her. Please don't let it be that way,
 God. Let him grow up and still love his mother.
  Jack's typewriter began its irregular bursts again.
  Still sitting in the chair beside Danny's reading table, she let her eyes
 wander around her son's room. The glider's wing had been neatly mended. His desk
 was piled high with picture books, coloring books, old Spiderman comic books
 with the covers half torn off, Crayolas, and an untidy pile of Lincoln Logs. The
 VW model was neatly placed above these lesser things, its shrink-wrap still
 undisturbed. He and his father would be putting it together tomorrow night or
 the night after if Danny went on at this rate, and never mind the end of the
 week. His pictures of Pooh and Eyore and Christopher Robin were tacked neatly to
 the wall, soon enough to be replaced with pin-ups and photographs of dope
smoking rock singers, she supposed. Innocence to experience. Human nature, baby.
 Grab it and growl. Still it made her sad. Next year he would be in school and
 she would lose at least half of him, maybe more, to his friends. She and Jack
 had tried to have another one for a while when things had seemed to be going
 well at Stovington, but she was on the pill again now. Things were too

 uncertain. God knew where they would be in nine months.
  Her eyes fell on the wasps' nest.
  It held the ultimate high place in Danny's room, resting on a large plastic
 plate on the table by his bed. She didn't like it, even if it was empty. She
 wondered vaguely if it might have germs, thought to ask Jack, then decided he
 would laugh at her. But she would ask the doctor tomorrow, if she could catch
 him with Jack out of the room. She didn't like the idea of that thing,
 constructed from the chewings and saliva of so many alien creatures, lying
 within a foot of her sleeping son's head.
  The water in the bathroom was still running, and she got up and went into the
 big bedroom to make sure everything was okay. Jack didn't look up; he was lost
 in the world he was making, staring at the typewriter, a filter cigarette
 clamped in his teeth.
  She knocked lightly on the closed bathroom room. 

  No answer.
  

  No answer. She tried the door. It was locked.
  
 She was worried now. The lack of any sound beneath the steadily
 running water made her uneasy.

  He's losing his temper, she thought, and was more afraid. He had not touched

 she began.

  "Break it," she said, and suddenly it was hard to talk. "Quick."
  He raised one foot and brought it down hard against the door to the right of
 the knob. The lock was a poor thing; it gave immediately and the door shuddered
 open, banging the tiled bathroom wall and rebounding halfway.
  "Danny!" she screamed.
  The water was running full force in the basin. Beside it, a tube of Crest with

 the cap off. Danny was sitting on the rim of the bathtub across the room, his
 toothbrush clasped limply in his left hand, a thin foam of toothpaste around his
 mouth. He was staring, trancelike, into the mirror on the front of the medicine
 cabinet above the washbasin. The expression on his face was one of drugged
 horror, and her first thought was that he was having some sort of epileptic
 seizure, that he might have swallowed his tongue.

 of angry reproach on his face but filed it away for later consideration), and
 lifted him up. She walked him back into the small bedroom, Danny

 nonsensical words repeated over and over. She looked up at Jack and there was
 only worry in his eyes now. He raised questioning eyebrows at her. She shook her
 head faintly.
  "Danny," she said. "Danny, Danny, Danny. 
S fine."

  At last Danny was quiet, only faintly trembling in her arms. Yet it was Jack
 he spoke to first, Jack who was now sitting beside them on the bed, and she felt
 the old faint pang
  (It
s always been him first)
  of jealousy. Jack had shouted at him, she had comforted him, yet it was to his
 father that Danny said,

 Jack said heartily, but Wendy felt a cold finger touch her

 Danny muttered.
  
 Jack was leaning forward, and Danny flinched in her arms.
  
re scaring him!" she said, and her voice was high, accusatory. It
 suddenly came to her that they were all scared. But of what?
  "I don
t know," Danny was saying to his father. "What . . . what
 did I say, Daddy?"
  "Nothing," Jack muttered. He took his handkerchief from his back pocket and
 wiped his mouth with it. Wendy had a moment of that sickening time-is-running
backward feeling again. It was a gesture she remembered well from his drinking
 days.
  "Why did you lock the door, Danny?" she asked gently. "Why did you do that?"
  "Tony," he said. "Tony told me to."
  They exchanged a glance over the top of his head.
  "Did Tony say why, son?" Jack asked quietly.
  "I was brushing my teeth and I was thinking about my reading," Danny said.
 "Thinking real bard. And . . . and I saw Tony way down in the mirror. He said he
 had to show me again."
  "You mean he was behind you?" Wendy asked.
  "No, he was in the mirror." Danny was very emphatic on this point. "Way down
 deep. And then I went through the mirror. The next thing I remember Daddy was
 shaking me and I thought I was being bad again."
  Jack winced as if struck.
  "No, doc," he said quietly.
  "Tony told you to lock the door?" Wendy asked, brushing his hair.
  "Yes."
  "And what did he want to show you?"
  Danny tensed in her arms; it was as if the muscles in his body had turned into
 something like piano wire. "I don

  At last Danny began to relax again.
  "Do you want me to stay a little while? Read you a story?"
  "No. Just the night light." He looked shyly at his father. "Would you stay,
 Daddy? For a minute?"
  "Sure, doc."
  Wendy sighed. "I

  She plugged in the night light, which showed Snoopy lying fast asleep on top
 of his doghouse. He had never wanted a night light until they moved into the
 Overlook, and then he had specifically requested one. She turned off the lamp
 and the overhead and looked back at them, the small white circle of Danny's
 face, and Jack's above it. She hesitated a moment
  (and then I went through the mirror)
  and then left them quietly.
  
 Jack asked, brushing Danny's hair off his forehead.
  

  

  

  There was silence for five minutes. Danny was still beneath his hand. Thinking
 the boy had dropped off, he was about to get up and leave quietly when Danny
 said from the brink of sleep:

  "Red drum? Sounds like something an Indian might take on the warpath."

  But Danny was alseep, breathing in long, slow strokes. Jack sat looking down
 at him for a moment, and a rush of love pushed through him like tidal water. Why
 had he yelled at the boy like that? It was perfectly normal for him to stutter a
 little. He had been coming out of a daze or some weird kind of trance, and
 stuttering was perfectly normal under those circumstances. Perfectly. And he

No.
Thank God you made that appointment,
You think that guy knows his stuff?
The checker said he was very good. That's all I know.
If there's something wrong, I'm going to send you and him to your mother's,
 Wendy.
No.
I know,
how you feel.
You don't know how I feel at all about her.
Wendy, there's no place else I can send you. You know that.
If you came--
Without this job we're done,
You know that.
When I had that interview with Ullman, I thought he was just blowing off his
 bazoo. Now I'm not so sure. Maybe I really shouldn't have tried this with you
 two along. Forty miles from nowhere.
I love you,
And Danny loves you even more, if that's possible. He
 would have been heartbroken, Jack. He will be, if you send us away.
Don't make it sound that way.
If the doctor says there's something wrong, I'll look for a job in
 Sidewinder,
If I can't get one in Sidewinder, Danny and I will go to
 Boulder. I can't go to my mother, Jack. Not on those terms. Don't ask me. I . .

I guess I know that. Cheer up. Maybe it's nothing.
Maybe.

Yes.

  He fled the heavy, crashing, echoing sounds through twisting, mazelike

  (Come out here, you little son of a bitch!)
  If he could get to the stairs going down, if he could get off this third
 floor, he might be all right. Even the elevator. If he could remember what had
 been forgotten. But it was dark and in his terror he had lost his orientation.
 He had turned down one corridor and then another, his heart leaping into his
 mouth like a hot

 insectile forms rise into the air, droning.
  "Get a magazine!" he yelled over his shoulder. "Kill them!"
  "Wasps?" she said, and for a moment she was inside herself, almost detached in
 her realization. Then her mind crosspatched, and knowledge was connected to
 emotion. "Wasps, oh Jesus, Jack, you said--"
  "Shut the fuck up and kill them!" he roared. "Will you do what I say!"
  One of them had landed on Danny

 her neck. "I got all of them," she said dully, "but one stung me. Jack, you said
 they were all dead." She began to cry.
  He slipped past her without answering and carried the Pyrex bowl over to the
 nest by Danny
There,
Come on.
Where did it get you?
My . . . on my wrist.
Let's see.
Are you allergic to stings?
Think hard! If you are, Danny might
 be. The fucking little bastards got him five or six times.
No,
I . . . I just hate them, that's all. Hate
 them.
Daddy, you said you killed them all. My hand . . . it really hurts.
Let's see it, doe . . . no, I'm not going to touch it. That would make it
 hurt even more. Just hold it out.
Oh Danny . . . oh, your poor hand!
Wendy, go get that spray stuff in the bathroom,
After we spray your hand, I want to take some Polaroids of it, doc. Then you
 sleep the rest of the night with us, Tay?
Sure,
But why are you going to take pictures?
So maybe we can sue the ass out of some people.
This won't hurt, honey,
Does it smart?
No. Feels better.
Now these. Crunch them up.
Isn't that a lot of aspirin?
It's a lot of stings,
You go and get rid of
 that nest, John Torrance. Right now.
Just a minute.
Jack, what are you doing?
He's gonna take some pictures of my hand,
and then
 we're gonna sue the ass out of some people. Right, Dad?
Right,
Hold it out, son. I figure about five thousand dollars a
 sting.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what,
I followed the directions on that fucking bug

 How else can you explain this?
Oh,
Should we take him to the doctor tonight?
Not unless he's really in pain,

Of course,
Oh honey, I'm so sorry.
It's okay, Mommy.

Of course I will.

 some.
  The overhead was still on. Jack crossed to the bunk setup, and as he glanced
 at the table beside it, his skin crawled into goose flesh. The short hairs on
 his neck prickled and tried to stand erect.
  He could hardly see the nest through the clear Pyrex bowl. The inside of the
 glass was crawling with wasps. It was hard to tell how many. Fifty at least.
 Maybe a hundred.
  His heart thudding slowly in his chest, he took his pictures and then set the
 camera down to wait for them to develop. He wiped his lips with the palm of his
 hand. One thought played over and over in his mind, echoing with
  (You lost your temper. You lost your temper. You lost your temper.)
  an almost superstitious dread. They had come back. He had killed the wasps but
 they had come back.
  In his mind he heard himself screaming into his frightened, crying son

  Stripped to his underpants, lying on the examination table, Danny Torrance
 looked very small. He was looking up at Dr. ("Just call me Bill") Edmonds, who
 was wheeling a large black machine up beside him. Danny rolled his eyes to get a
 better look at it.

 into the next room, looking at it.

 Danny sighed, and offered his arm up for sacrifice.

 legs thoughtfully.

 their doors sliding shut one after another, locking with a click. Written on the
 small tabs in the center of each door was: A-C, SECRET; D-G, SECRET; and so on.
 This made Danny feel a little easier.
  Cautiously he said:

  "Is he your age?"
  "No. He

  "And he always comes just before you pass out?"

 silently by in the darkness with some horrible thing lolling in it, past a sound
 like sweetly chiming church bells, past a clock under a dome of glass.
  Then the dark was pierced feebly by a single light, festooned with cobwebs.
 The weak glow disclosed a stone floor that looked damp and unpleasant. Somewhere
 not far distant was a steady mechanical roaring sound, but muted, not
 frightening. Soporific. It was the thing that would be forgotten, Danny thought
 with dreamy surprise.
  As his eyes adjusted to the gloom he could see Tony just ahead of him, a
 silhouette. Tony was looking at something and Danny strained his eyes to see
 what it was.

  Danny recognized the doctor, then his surroundings in the office. He began to
 shudder helplessly. Edmonds held him.
  When the reaction began to subside, Edmonds asked, "You said something about
 monsters, Danny-what was it?"
  "This inhuman place," he said gutturally. "Tony told me. . . this inhuman

 paused, fiddling with a pen. "He went into a trance while I was with him. At my
 request. Exactly as you described him in the bathroom last night. All his
 muscles went lax, his body slumped, his eyeballs rotated outward. Textbook auto
hypnosis. I was amazed. I still am."
  The Torrances sat forward. "What happened?" Wendy asked tensely, and Edmonds
 carefully related Danny

pounding.
Tony again,
What does it mean?
Have you any idea?
A few. You might not like them.
Go ahead anyway,
From what Danny told me, his `invisible friend' was truly a friend until you
 folks moved out here from New England. Tony has only become a threatening figure
 since that move. The pleasant interludes have become nightmarish, even more
 frightening to your son because he can't remember exactly what the nightmares
 are about. That's common enough. We all remember our pleasant dreams more
 clearly than the scary ones. There seems to be a buffer somewhere between the
 conscious and the subconscious, and one hell of a bluenose lives in there. This
 censor only lets through a small amount, and often what does come through is
 only symbolic. That's oversimplified Freud, but it does pretty much describe
 what we know of the mind's interaction with itself.
You think moving has upset Danny that badly?
It may have, if the move took place under traumatic circumstances,
Did it?
I was teaching at a prep school,
I lost my job.
I see,
There's more here, I'm afraid. It may be painful to you. Your son
 seems to believe you two have seriously contemplated divorce. He spoke of it in
 an offhand way, but only because he believes you are no longer considering it.

 keep your marriage together. Your husband was drinking too much. There was the
 incident of the broken arm. The ominous quiet between you.
But things have changed. You know, schizoid behavior is a
 pretty common thing in children. It's accepted, because all we adults have this
 unspoken agreement that children are lunatics. They have invisible friends. They
 may go and sit in the closet when they're depressed, withdrawing from the world.
 They attach talismanic importance to a special blanket, or a teddy bear, or a
 stuffed tiger. They suck their thumbs. When an adult sees things that aren't
 there, we consider him ready for the rubber room. When a child says he's seen a
 troll in his bedroom or a vampire outside the window, we simply smile
 indulgently. We have a one-sentence explanation that explains the whole range of
 such phenomena in children--
He'll grow out of it,
My very words,
Yes. Now I would guess that Danny
 was in a pretty good position to develop a full-fledged psychosis. Unhappy home
 life, a big imagination, the invisible friend who was so real to him that he
 nearly became real to you. Instead of `growing out of' is childhood
 schizophrenia, he might well have grown into it.
And become autistic?
Possible but not necessarily. He might simply have entered Tony's world
 someday and never come back to what he calls `real things.' 
God,
But now the basic situation has changed drastically. Mr. Torrance no longer

 into a tighter family unit than ever before---certainly tighter than my own,
 where my wife and kids may see me for only two or three hours a day. To my mind,
 he is in the perfect healing situation. And I think the very fact that he is
 able to differentiate so sharply between Tony's world and `real things' says a
 lot about the fundamentally healthy state of his mind. He says that you two are
 no longer considering divorce. Is he as right as I think he is?
Yes,
He really doesn't need Tony anymore. Danny is flushing him
 out of his system. Tony no longer brings pleasant visions but hostile nightmares
 that are too frightening for him to remember except fragmentarily. He
 internalized Tony during a difficult--desperate--life situation, and Tony is not
 leaving easily. But he is leaving. Your son is a little like a junkie kicking
 the habit.

Yes, I did. She was killed outside our home

 through the small stone arch. His nose wrinkled at the smell of rotting paper.
 Behind him the boiler kicked on with a thundering whoosh, making him jump.
  He flickered the light around, whistling tunelessly between his teeth. There
 was a scale-model Andes range down here: dozens of boxes and crates stuffed with
 papers, most of them white and shapeless with age and damp. Others had broken
 open and spilled yellowed sheaves of paper onto the stone floor. There were
 bales of newspaper tied up with hayrope. Some boxes contained what looked like
 ledgers, and others contained invoices bound with rubber bands. Jack pulled one
 out and put the flashlight beam on it.

  The paper was the Rocky Mountain News, dated December 19, 1963. He dropped it
 back onto its pile.
  He supposed he was fascinated by that commonplace sense of history that anyone
 can feel glancing through the fresh news of ten or twenty years ago. He found
 gaps in the piled newspapers and records; nothing from 1937 to 1945, from 1957
 to 1960, from 1962 to 1963. Periods when the hotel had been closed, he guessed.

 exploding out of this central place in a hundred directions.
  He stood beneath the cobwebby light, took his handkerchief from his back
 pocket without thinking, and scrubbed at his lips with it. And that was when he
 saw the scrapbook.
  A pile of five boxes stood on his left like some tottering Pisa. The one on
 top was stuffed with more invoices and ledgers. Balanced on top of those,
 keeping its angle of repose for who knew how many years, was a thick scrapbook
 with white leather covers, its pages bound with two hanks of gold string that
 bad been tied along the binding in gaudy bows.
  Curious, he went over and took it down. The top cover was thick with dust. He
 held it on a plane at lip level, blew the dust off in a cloud, and opened it. As
 he did so a card fluttered out and he grabbed it in mid-air before it could fall
 to the stone floor. It was rich and creamy, dominated by a raised engraving of
 the Overlook with every window alight. The lawn and playground were decorated
 with glowing Japanese lanterns. It looked almost as though you could step right
 into it, an Overlook Hotel that had existed thirty years ago.

  He could almost see them in the dining room, the richest men in America and
 their women. Tuxedos and glimmering starched shirts; evening gowns; the band
 playing; gleaming high-heeled pumps. The clink of glasses, the jocund pop of
 champagne corks. The war was over, or almost over. The future lay ahead, clean
 and shining. America was the colossus of the world and at last she knew it and
 accepted it.

            Derwent Says Overlook Will Be "Showplace of the World"
                       By David Felton, Features Editor
    The Overlook Hotel has been opened and reopened in its thirty-eight-year
    history, but rarely with such style and dash as that promised by Horace
    Derwent, the mysterious California millionaire who is the latest owner of
    the hostelry.
      Derwent, who makes no secret of having sunk more than one million dollars
    into his newest venture--and some say the figure is closer to three
    million--says that "The new Overlook will be one of the world

      When Derwent, who is rumored to have substantial Las Vegas holdings, was
    asked if his purchase and refurbishing of the Overlook signaled the opening
    gun in a battle to legalize casino-style gambling in Colorado, the
    aircraft, movie, munitions, and shipping magnate denied it . . . with a
    smile. 
 he said, 
t
    think I
ve got too many of my markers out there for
    me to do that! I have no interest in lobbying for legalized gambling in
    Colorado. It would be spitting into the wind."
      When the Overlook opens officially (there was a gigantic and hugely
    successful party there some time ago when the actual work was finished),
    the newly painted, papered, and decorated rooms will be occupied by a
    stellar guest list, ranging from Chic designer Corbat Stani to...
  Smiling bemusedly, Jack turned the page. Now he was looking at a full-page ad
 from the New York Sunday Times travel section. On the page after that a story on
 Derwent himself, a balding man with eyes that pierced you even from an old
 newsprint photo. He was wearing rimless spectacles and a forties-style pencil
line mustache that did nothing at all to make him look like Errol Flynn. His
 face was that of an accountant. It was the eyes that made him look like someone
 or something else.
  Jack skimmed the article rapidly. He knew most of the information from a
 Newsweek story on Derwent the year before. Born poor in St. Paul, never finished
 high school, joined the Navy instead. Rose rapidly, then left in a bitter
 wrangle over the patent on a new type of propeller that he had designed. In the
 tug of war between the Navy and an unknown young man named Horace Derwent, Uncle
 Sam came off the predictable winner. But Uncle Sam had never gotten another
 patent, and there had been a lot of them.
  In the late twenties and early thirties, Derwent turned to aviation. He bought

 out a bankrupt cropdusting company, turned it into an airmail service, and
 prospered. More patents followed: a new monoplane wing design, a bomb carriage
 used on the Flying Fortresses that had rained fire on Hamburg and Dresden and
 Berlin, a machine gun that was cooled by alcohol, a prototype of the ejection
 seat later used in United States jets.
  And along the line, the accountant who lived in the same skin as the inventor
 kept piling up the investments. A piddling string of munition factories in New
 York and New Jersey. Five textile mills in New England. Chemical factories in
 the bankrupt and groaning South. At the end of the Depression his wealth had
 been nothing but a handful of controlling interests, bought at abysmally low
 prices, salable only at lower prices still. At one point Derwent boasted that he
 could liquidate completely and realize the price of a threeyear-old Chevrolet.
  There bad been rumors, Jack recalled, that some of the means employed by
 Derwent to keep his head above water were less than savory. Involvement with
 bootlegging. Prostitution in the Midwest. Smuggling in the coastal areas of the
 South where his fertilizer factories were. Finally an association with the
 nascent western gambling interests.

                      By Rodney Conklin, Financial Editor
    The Overlook Hotel, a scenic pleasure palace in the Colorado high country
    and once the private plaything of millionaire Horace Derwent, is at the
    center of a financial tangle which is only now beginning to come to light.
      On April 10 of last year the hotel was purchased by a Las Vegas firm,
    High Country Investments, as a key club for wealthy executives of both
    foreign and domestic breeds. Now informed sources say that High Country is
    headed by Charles Grondin, 53, who was the head of California Land
    Development Corp. until 1959, when he resigned to take the position of
    executive veep in the Chicago home office of Derwent Enterprises.
      This has led to speculation that High Country Investments may be
    controlled by Derwent, who may have acquired the Overlook for the second
    time, and under decidedly peculiar circumstances.
      Grondin, who was indicted and acquitted on charges of tax evasion in
    1960, could not be reached for comment, and Horace Derwent, who guards his
    own privacy jealously, had no comment when reached by telephone. State
    Representative Dick Bows of Golden has called for a complete investigation
    into . . .
  That clipping was dated July 27, 1964. The next was a column from a Sunday
 paper that September. The byline belonged to Josh Brannigar, a muck-raking
 investigator of the Jack Anderson breed. Jack vaguely recalled that Brannigar
 had died in 1968 or

  "Fig-fig, madame?" he asked, still rubbing. "Dirty peeotures? Unnatural
 positions?" As they went through the arch, he threw one glance back at the box
 where the scrapbook
  (whose?)
  was hidden. With the light out it was only a shadow. He was relieved that he
 had gotten Wendy away. His lust became less acted, more natural, as they
 approached the stairs.
  "Maybe," she said. "After we get you a sandwich-yeek!" She twisted away from
 him, giggling. "That tickles!"
  "It teekles nozzing like Jock Torrance would like to teekle you, madame."
  "Lay off, Jock. How about a ham and cheese . . . for the first course?"
  They went up the stairs together, and Jack didn

  Every big hotel has got a ghost. Why? Hell, people come and go...
  Then Wendy shut the basement door behind them, closing it into darkness.

  It was a perfectly ordinary door, no different from any other door on the
 first two floors of the hotel. It was dark gray, halfway down a corridor that
 ran at right angles to the main second-floor hallway. The numbers on the door
 looked no different from the house numbers on the Boulder apartment building
 they had lived in. A 2, a 1, and a 7. Big deal. Just below them was a tiny glass
 circle, a peephole. Danny had tried several of them. From the inside you got a
 wide, fish-eye view of the corridor. From outside you could screw up your eye
 seven ways to Sunday and still not see a thing. A dirty gyp:
  (Why are you here?)
  After the walk behind the Overlook, he and Mommy had come back and she had
 fixed him his favorite lunch, a cheese and bologna sandwich plus Campbell
s kitchen and talked. The radio was on, getting thin and
 crackly music from the Estes Park station. The kitchen was his favorite place in
 the hotel, and he guessed that Mommy and Daddy must feel the same way, because
 after trying their meals in the dining room for three days or so, they had begun
 eating in the kitchen by mutual consent, setting up chairs around Dick
 Hallorann
s cooking had begun to taste better as
 soon as they began to eat it in the kitchen. He kept discovering little flashes

 had manufactured the bug bomb could be sued successfully because there was only

 the maids
s rooms, looking for something interesting,
 not finding it, a small boy padding along a dark blue carpet woven with twisting
 black lines. He had tried a room door from time to time, but of course they were
 all locked. The passkey was hanging down in the office, he knew where, but Daddy
 had told him he shouldn
t want to. Did be?
  (Why are you here?)
  There was nothing aimless about it after all. He had been drawn to Room 217 by
 a morbid kind of curiosity. He remembered a story Daddy had read to him once
 when he was drunk. That had been a long time ago, but the story was just as
 vivid now as when Daddy had read it to him. Mommy had scolded Daddy and asked
 what he was doing, reading a three-year-old baby something so horrible. The name

 thought at first Daddy was saying Bluebird, and there were no bluebirds in the
 story, or birds of any kind for that matter. Actually the story was about

  But Mr. Hallorann--Dick--had also said he didn

  He plunged his left hand into his pocket and it came out holding the passkey.
 It had been there all along, of course.
  He held it by the square metal tab on the end which had OFFICE printed on it
 in Magic Marker. He twirled the key on its chain, watching it go around and
 around. After several minutes of this he stopped and slipped the passkey into
 the lock. It slid in smoothly, with no hitch, as if it had wanted to be there

  (I don

 remembered that directly around this corner, on the way back to the stairs,
 there was one of those old-fashioned fire extinguishers curled up against the

 department. Daddy said that the chemical extinguishers, which sprayed foam or
 CO, were much better. The chemicals smothered fires, took away the oxygen they
 needed to burn, while a high-pressure spray might just spread the flames around.
 Daddy said that Mr. Ullman should replace the old-fashioned hoses right along
 with the old-fashioned boiler, but Mr. Ullman would probably do neither because
 he was a CHEAP PRICK. Danny knew that this was one of the worst epithets his
 father could summon. It was applied to certain doctors, dentists, and appliance
 repairmen, and also to the head of his English Department at Stovington, who had
 disallowed some of Daddy

 like the way the word was used in connection with that long fiat hose. EMERGENCY

 was
t
 like the way that hose hung so blandly on the wall. When he was alone, he always
 skittered past these extinguishers as fast as he could. No particular reason. It
 just felt better to go fast. It felt safer.
  Now, heart thumping loudly in his chest, he came around the corner and looked
 down the hall past the extinguisher to the stairs. Mommy was down there,
 sleeping. And if Daddy was back from his walk, he would probably be sitting in
 the kitchen, eating a sandwich and reading a book. He would just walk right past
 that old extinguisher and go downstairs.
  He started toward it, moving closer to the far wall until his right arm was
 brushing the expensive silk paper. Twenty steps away. Fifteen. A dozen.
  When he was ten steps away, the brass nozzle suddenly rolled off the fat loop
 it had been lying
  (sleeping?)
  on and fell to the hall carpet with a dull thump. It lay there, the dark bore
 of its muzzle pointing at Danny. He stopped immediately, his shoulders twitching
 forward with the suddenness of his scare. His blood thumped thickly in his ears
 and temples. His mouth had gone dry and sour, his hands curled into fists. Yet
 the nozzle of the hose only lay there, its brass casing glowing mellowly, a loop
 of flat canvas leading back up to the red-painted frame bolted to the wall.
  So it had fallen off, so what? It was only a fire extinguisher, nothing else.
 It was stupid to think that it looked like some poison snake from "Wide World of
 Animals" that had heard him and woken up. Even if the stitched canvas did look a
 little bit like scales. He would just step over it and go down the hall to the
 stairs, walking a little bit fast, maybe, to make sure it didn
s all.
  Danny stared at the hose on the floor and thought of wasps.
  Eight steps away, the nozzle of the hose gleamed peacefully at him from the
 rug as if to say: Don
m just a hose, that
t all, what I do to you won
s not going to strike at you, he thought hysterically.
 How can it strike at you, bite at you, when it
s full of wasps.
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (132 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  His internal temperature plummeted to ten below zero. He stared at the black
 bore in the center of the nozzle, nearly hypnotized. Maybe it was full of wasps,
 secret wasps, their brown bodies bloated with poison, so full of autumn poison
 that it dripped from their stingers in clear drops of fluid.
  Suddenly he knew that he was nearly frozen with terror; if he did not make his
 feet go now, they would become locked to the carpet and he would stay here,
 staring at the black hole in the center of the brass nozzle like a bird staring
 at a snake, he would stay here until his daddy found him and then what would
 happen?
  With a high moan, he made himself run. As he reached the hose, some trick of
 the light made the nozzle seem to move, to revolve as if to strike, and he
 leaped high in the air above it; in his panicky state it seemed that his legs
 pushed him nearly all the way to the ceiling, that he could feel the stiff back
 hairs that formed his cowlick brushing the hallway
t have been so.
  He came down on the other side of the hose and ran, and suddenly he heard it
 behind him, coming for him, the soft dry whicker of that brass snake
s dry hackles. At his heels now,
 perhaps rising up with the clear poison dribbling from its brass snout.
  Danny reached the stairs and had to pinwheel his arms crazily for balance. For
 one moment it seemed sure that he would cartwheel over and go head-for-heels to
 the bottom.
  He threw a glance back over his shoulder.
  The hose had not moved. It lay as it had lain, one loop off the frame, the
 brass nozzle on the hall floor, the nozzle pointing disinterestedly away from
 him. You see, stupid? he berated himself. You made it all up, scaredy-cat. It
 was all your imagination, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat.
  He clung to the stairway railing, his legs trembling in reaction.
  (It never chased you)
  his mind told him, and seized on that thought, and played it back.
  (never chased you, never chased you, never did, never did)
  It was nothing to be afraid of. Why, he could go back and put that hose right
 into its frame, if he wanted to. He could, but he didn
t . . .
 quite . . . catch him?
  The hose lay on the carpet, almost seeming to ask him if he would like to come
 back and try again.

  Panting, Danny ran downstairs.

  The Sidewinder Public Library was a small, retiring building one block down
 from the town
s
 flowers. On the lawn was a large bronze statue of a Civil War general Jack had
 never heard of, although he had been something of a Civil War buff in his
 teenage years.
  The newspaper files were kept downstairs. They consisted of the Sidewinder
 Gazette that had gone bust in 1963, the Estes Park daily, and the Boulder
 Camera. No Denver papers at all.
  Sighing, Jack settled for the Camera.
  When the files reached 1965, the actual newspapers were replaced by spools of
 microfilm ("A federal grant," the librarian told him brightly. "We hope to do
 1958 to 
re so slow, aren
t you? I just know you will. Call if you need me.").
 The only reading machine bad a lens that had somehow gotten warped, and by the
 time Wendy put her hand on his shoulder some forty-five minutes after he had
 switched from the actual papers, he had a juicy thumper of a headache.

 Stovington and Danny was still a crib-infant. Where are you going, Jack? When
 will you be back? How much money do you have with you? Are you going to take the
 car? Is Al going to be with you? Will one of you stay sober? On and on. She had,
 pardon the expression, driven him to drink. Maybe that hadn't been the only
 reason, but by Christ let's tell the truth here and admit it was one of them.

 he had such a cunt of a headache.
  

  He snapped his head away from her fingers. 

  She recoiled from his hot eyes and tried on a smile that was a size too small.

 She was starting away now, her smile dissolving into a bewildered expression of
 hurt.
  He called to her: "Wendy?"

  He got up and went over to her. "I

 She pawed in her purse and came up with a tin of Anacin. 

  He took the tin. 
 He saw the small recoil on her face and
 understood. It had been a bitter sort of joke between them at first, before the
 drinking had gotten too bad for jokes. He had claimed that Excedrin was the only
 nonprescription drug ever invented that could stop a hangover dead in its
 tracks. Absolutely the only one. He had begun to think of his morning-after
 thumpers as Excedrin Headache Number Vat 69.

 gripper like this one, you ought to at least be allowed the pleasure of a few
 drinks to balance it off.
  He tried to put the thought from his mind, more ill tempered than ever. He
 went to the main desk, fingering a matchbook cover with a telephone number on
 it.
  
am, do you have a pay telephone?"
  "No, sir, but you can use mine if it

  
s long-distance, sorry."
  "Well then, I guess the drugstore would be your best bet. They have a booth."
  "Thanks."
  He went out and down the walk, past the anonymous Civil War general. He began
 to walk toward the business block, hands stuffed in his pockets, head thudding
 like a leaden bell. The sky was also leaden; it was November 7, and with the new
 month the weather had become threatening. There had been a number of snow
 flurries. There had been snow in October too, but that had melted. The new
 flurries had stayed, a light frosting over everything-it sparkled in the
 sunlight like fine crystal. But there had been no sunlight today, and even as he
 reached the drugstore it began to spit snow again.
  The phone booth was at the back of the building, and he was halfway down an
 aisle of patent medicines, jingling his change in his pocket, when his eyes fell
 on the white boxes with their green print. He took one of them to the cashier,
 paid, and went back to the telephone booth. He pulled the door closed, put his
 change and matchbook cover on the counter, and dialed O.
  "Your call, please?"
  "Fort Lauderdale, Florida, operator." He gave her the number there and the
 number in the booth. When she told him it would be a dollar ninety for the first
 three minutes, he dropped eight quarters into the slot, wincing each time the
 bell bonged in his ear.
  Then, left in limbo with only the faraway clickings and gabblings of
 connection-making, he took the green-bottle of Excedrin out of its box, pried up
 the white cap, and dropped the wad of cotton batting to the floor of the booth.
 Cradling, the phone receiver between his ear and shoulder, he shook out three of
 the white tablets and lined them up on the counter beside his remaining change.
 He recapped the bottle and put it in his pocket.
  At the other end, the phone was picked up on the first ring.
  "Surf-Sand Resort, how may we help you?" the perky female voice asked.
  "I

  "One moment, please." She put him on hold.

 hangover headache or one like this one, chewing them seemed to make them get to
 work quicker. He had read somewhere that chewing aspirin could become addictive.
 Where had he read that, anyway? Frowning, he tried to think. And then Ullman
 came on the line.
  "Torrance? What

  "Very funny. Why are you calling? I

  Smiling, Jack popped another Excedrin into his mouth and chewed it.
  "She sold out after a rather well known U.S. senator died of a heart attack up

  "I just do not believe your cheek, your bloody damned impertinence," Ullman

  For a moment Jack
Who owns the Overlook now? Is it still Derwent Enterprises? Or are you too
 smallfry to know?
I think that will do, Mr. Torrance. You are an employee of the hotel, no
 different from a busboy or a kitchen pot scrubber. I have no intention of--
Okay, I'll write Al,
He'll know; after all, he's on the Board of
 Directors. And I might just add a little P.S. to the effect that--
Derwent doesn't own it.
What? I couldn't quite make that out.
I said Derwent doesn't own it. The stockholders are all Easterners. Your
 friend Mr. Shockley owns the largest block of stock himself, better than thirty
five per cent. You would know better than I if he has any ties to Derwent.
Who else?
I have no intention of divulging the names of the other stockholders to you,
 Mr. Torrance. I intend to bring this whole matter to the attention of--
One other question.
I am under no obligation to you.
Most of the Overlook's history--savory and unsavory alike--I found in a
 scrapbook that was in the cellar. Big thing with white leather covers. Gold
 thread for binding. Do you have any idea whose scrapbook that might be?
None at all.
Is it possible it could have belonged to Grady? The caretaker who killed
 himself?
Mr. Torrance,
I am by no means sure
 that Mr. Grady could read, let alone dig out the rotten apples you have been
 wasting my time with.
I'm thinking of writing a book about the Overlook Hotel. I thought if I
 actually got through it, the owner of the scrapbook would like to have an
 acknowledgment at the front.
I think writing a book about the Overlook would be very unwise,
Especially a book done from your . . . uh, point of view.
Your opinion doesn't surprise me.

  Now he said: "What you

  wondering why in the name of God he had called Ullman in the first place.
  (You lost your temper again, Jack.)
  Yes. Yes, he had. No sense trying to deny it. And the bell of it was, he had
 no idea how much influence that cheap little prick had over Al, no more than he
 knew how much bullshit Al would take from him in the name of auld lang syne. If
 Ullman was as good as he claimed to be, and if he gave Al a he-goes-or-I-go

 out, but I managed it.
  He opened his eyes and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief. He wanted a
 drink. Hell, he needed one. There was a cafe just down the street, surely he had
 time for a quick beer on his way up to the park, just one to lay the dust . . .
  He clenched his hands together helplessly.
  The question recurred: Why had he called Ullman in the first place? The number
 of the Surf-Sand in Lauderdale had been written in a small notebook by the phone
 and the CB radio in the office-plumbers' numbers, carpenters, glaziers,
 electricians, others. Jack bad copied it onto the matchbook cover shortly after
 getting out of bed, the idea of calling Ullman fullblown and gleeful in his
 mind. But to what purpose? Once, during the drinking phase, Wendy had accused
 him of desiring his own destruction but not possessing the necessary moral fiber
 to support a full-blown deathwish. So he manufactured ways in which other people
 could do it, lopping a piece at a time off himself and their family. Could it be
 true? Was be afraid somewhere inside that the Overlook might be just what he
 needed to finish his play and generally collect tip his shit and get it
 together? Was he blowing the whistle on himself? Please God no, don't let it be
 that way. Please.
  He closed his eyes and an image immediately arose on the darkened screen of
 his inner lids: sticking his hand through that hole in the shingles to pull out
 the rotted flashing, the sudden needling sting, his own agonized, startled cry
 in the still and unheeding air: Oh you goddamn fucking son of a bitch . . .
  Replaced with an image two years earlier, himself stumbling into the house at
 three in the morning, drunk, falling over a table and sprawling full-length on
 the floor, cursing, waking Wendy up on the couch. Wendy turning on the light,
 seeing his clothes ripped and smeared from some cloudy parking-lot scuffle that
 had occurred at a vaguely remembered honky-tonk just over the New Hampshire
 border hours before, crusted blood under his nose, now looking up at his wife,
 blinking stupidly in the light like a mole in the sunshine, and Wendy saying
 dully, You son of a bitch, you woke Danny up. If you don't care about yourself,
 can't you care a little bit about us? Oh, why do I even bother talking to you?
  The telephone rang, making him jump. He snatched it off the cradle,
 illogically sure it must be either Ullman or Al Shockley. 
 he barked.

ll have to break some ones," he said. "Wait a minute."
  He put the phone on the shelf, deposited his last six quarters, then went out
 to the cashier to get more. He performed the transaction automatically, his mind
 running in a single closed circle like a squirrel on an exercise wheel.
  Why had he called Ullman?
  Because Ullman had embarrassed him? He had been embarrassed before, and by
 real masters-the Grand Master, of course, being himself. Simply to crow at the
 man, expose his hypocrisy? Jack didn
t hold water
 either. The chances of Ullman knowing who the owner was were no more than two in
 a thousand. At the interview, he had treated the cellar as another country-a
 nasty underdeveloped one at that. If he had really wanted to know, he would have
 called Watson, whose winter number was also in the office notebook. Even Watson
 would not have been a sure thing but surer than Ullman.
  And telling him about the book idea, that had been another stupid thing.
 Incredibly stupid. Besides jeopardizing his job, he could be closing off wide
 channels of information once Ullman called around and told people to beware of
 New Englanders bearing questions about the Overlook Hotel. He could have done
 his researches quietly, mailing off polite letters, perhaps even arranging some
 interviews in the spring . . . and then laughed up his sleeve at Ullman

  They walked back to where the hotel truck was slantparked against the curb,
 Jack in the middle, his left arm around Wendy's shoulders, his right hand
 holding Danny's hand. He had called it home for the first time, for better or
 worse.
  As he got behind the truck's wheel it occurred to him that while he was
 fascinated by the Overlook, he didn't much like it. He wasn't sure it was good
 for either his wife or his son or himself. Maybe that was why he had called
 Ullman.
  To be fired while there was still time.
  He backed the truck out of its parking space and headed them out of town and
 up into the mountains.

                                NIGHT THOUGHTS
  It was ten o'clock. Their quarters were filled with counterfeit sleep.
  Jack lay on his side facing the wall, eyes open, listening to Wendy's slow and
 regular breathing. The taste of dissolved aspirin was still on his tongue,
 making it feel rough and slightly numb. Al Shockley had called at quarter of
 six, quarter of eight back East. Wendy had been downstairs with Danny, sitting
 in front of the lobby fireplace and reading.
  
 the operator said, 

  
 He had switched the phone to his right hand, had dug his
 handkerchief out of his back pocket with his left, and had wiped his tender lips
 with it. Then he lit a cigarette.
  Al's voice then, strong in his ear: 

  
 He snuffed the cigarette and groped for the Excedrin bottle.
  
s going on, Jack? I got this weird phone call from Stuart Ullman this
 afternoon. And when Stu Ullman calls long-distance out of his own pocket, you
 know the shit has hit the fan."
  "Ullman has nothing to worry about, Al. Neither do you."

It is. But I did find out--
I know the hotel's history.
So I called him up and poked him with it. I
 admit it wasn't very bright, and I sure wouldn't do it again. End of story.
Stu says you're planning to do a little dirty-laundry-airing yourself.
Stu is an asshole!
I told him I had an idea of
 writing about the Overlook, yes. I do. I think this place forms an index of the
 whole post-World War II American character. That sounds like an inflated claim,
 stated so baldly . . . I know it does . . . but it's all here, Al! My God, it
 could be a great book. But it's far in the future, I can promise you that, I've
 got more on my plate right now than I can eat, and--
Jack, that's not good enough.
What? Al, did you say--?
I said what I said. How long is far in the future, Jack? For you it may be
 two years, maybe five. For me it's thirty or forty, because I expect to be
 associated with the Overlook for a long time. The thought of you doing some sort
 of a scum-job on my hotel and passing it off as a great piece of American
 writing, that makes me sick.

 thought I owed you some help. You remember the war?

 that one for yourself. I got you this hotel thing, a nice quiet place for you to
 get yourself together, finish your play, and wait it out until Harry Effinger
 and I could convince the rest of those guys that they made a big mistake. Now it
 looks like you want to chew my arm off on your way to a bigger killing. Is that
 the way you say thanks to your friends, Jack?"
  "No," he whispered.
  He didn
What?
No,
That is not the way I treat my friends. And you know it.
How do I know it? At the worst, you're planning to smear my hotel by digging
 up bodies that were decently buried years ago. At the best, you call up my
 temperamental but extremely competent hotel manager and work him into a frenzy
 as part of some . . . some stupid kid's game.
It was more than a game, Al. It's easier for you. You don't have to take some
 rich friend's charity. You don't need a friend in court because you are the
 court. The fact that you were one step from a brown-bag lush goes pretty much
 unmentioned, doesn't it?
I suppose it does,
But Jack, Jack . . . I can't help that. I can't
 change that.
I know,
Am I fired? I guess you better tell me if I am.
Not if you'll do two things for me.
All right.
Hadn't you better hear the conditions before you accept them?
No. Give me your deal and I'll take it. There's Wendy and Danny to think
 about. If you want my balls, I'll send them airmail.
Are you sure selfpity is a luxury you can afford, Jack?
At this
 point I feel it's the only one I can afford. Fire away . . . no pun intended.
First, no more calls to Ullman. Not
 even if the place burns down. If that happens, call the maintenance man, that
 guy who swears all the time, you know who I mean . . .
Watson.
Yes.
Okay. Done.
Second, you promise me, Jack. Word of honor. No book about a famous Colorado

  And so he had hung up and that was when the cramps had come, hitting him like
 lightning bolts, making him curl up in front of the telephone like a penitent,
 hands over his belly, head throbbing like a monstrous bladder.
  The moving wasp, having stung moves on . . .
  It had passed a little when Wendy came upstairs and asked him who had been on
 the phone.
  "Al," he said. "He called to ask how things were going. I said they were
 fine."
  "Jack, you look terrible. Are you sick?"

m going to bed early. No sense trying to write."
  "Can I get you some warm milk?"
  He smiled wanly. "That would be nice."
  And now he lay beside her, feeling her warm and sleeping thigh against his
 own. Thinking of the conversation with Al, how he had groveled, still made him
 hot and cold by turns. Someday there would be a reckoning. Someday there would
 be a book, not the soft and thoughtful thing he had first considered, but a gem
hard work of research, photo section and all, and he would pull apart the entire
 Overlook history, nasty, incestuous ownership deals and all. He would spread it
 all out for the reader like a dissected crayfish. And if Al Shockley had
 connections with the Derwent empire, then God help him.
  Strung up like piano wire, he lay staring into the dark, knowing it might be
 hours yet before he could sleep.

  The most frightening thing, vaporous and unmentioned, perhaps unmentionable,
 was that all of Jack

  And the call from Al. At about the same time it had come, Danny had lost all
 interest in the story they had been reading. He left her to sit by the fire and
 crossed to the main desk where Jack had constructed a roadway for his matchbox
 cars and trucks. The Violent Violet Volkswagen was there and Danny had begun to
 push it rapidly back and forth. Pretending to read her own book but actually
 looking at Danny over the top of it, she had seen an odd amalgam of the ways she
 and Jack expressed anxiety. The wiping of the lips. Running both hands nervously
 through his hair, as she had done while waiting for Jack to come home from his
 round of the bars. She couldn

 she was thinking about Aileen in the waiting room that day? And

  She decided that it was time to talk to Danny about the Overlook . . . and
 high time she tried to get Danny to talk to her. Tomorrow. For sure. The two of
 them would be going down to the Sidewinder Public Library to see if they could
 get him some second-grade-level books on an extended loan through the winter,
 and she would talk to him. And frankly. With that thought she felt a little
 easier, and at last began to drift toward sleep.
                                     * * *
  Danny lay awake in his bedroom, eyes open, left arm encircling his aged and
 slightly worse-for-wear Pooh (Pooh had lost one shoe-button eye and was oozing
 stuffing from half a dozen sprung seams), listening to his parents sleep in
 their bedroom. He felt as if he were standing unwilling guard over them. The
 nights were the worst of all. He hated the nights and the constant howl of the
 wind around the west side of the hotel.
  His glider floated overhead from a string. On his bureau the VW model, brought
 up from the roadway setup downstairs, glowed a dimly fluorescent purple. His
 books were in the bookcase, his coloring books on the desk. A place for
 everything and everything in its place. Mommy said. Then you know where it is
 when you want it. But now things had been misplaced. Things were missing. Worse
 still, things had been added, things you couldn
t see that would sneak up behind you, a tomahawk in one hand
 and a scalping knife in the other . . .
  He shifted uneasily in his bed, his eyes searching out the comforting glow of
 the night light. Things were worse here. He knew that much for sure. At first

 went around wiping his lips with his handkerchief and his eyes were far away and
 cloudy. Mommy was worried about him and Danny, too. He didn
s father taught arithmetic at Daddy
s daddy taught
 history there. Most of the kids at the nursery school were associated either
 with Stovington Prep or with the small IBM plant just outside of town. The prep
 kids chummed in one group, the IBM kids in another. There were cross
friendships, of course, but it was natural enough for the kids whose fathers
 knew each other to more or less stick together. When there was an adult scandal
 in one group, it almost always filtered down to the children in some wildly
 mutated form or other, but it rarely jumped to the other group.
  He and Scotty were sitting in the play rocketship when Scotty jerked his thumb
 at Robin and said: "You know that kid?"
  "Yeah," Danny said.
  Scott leaned forward. "His dad LOST HIS MARBLES last night. They took him
 away."
  "Yeah? Just for losing some marbles?"
  Scotty looked disgusted. "He went crazy. You know." Scott crossed his eyes,
 flopped out his tongue, and twirled his index fingers in large elliptical orbits
 around his ears. "They took him t0 THE BUGHOUSE."
  "Wow," Danny said. "When will they let him come back?"
  "Never-never-never," Scotty said darkly.
  In the course of that day and the next, Danny heard that
  a.) Mr. Stenger had tried to kill everybody in his family, including Robin,
 with his World War II souvenir pistol;
  b.) Mr. Stenger ripped the house to pieces while he was STINKO;
  c.) Mr. Stenger had been discovered eating a bowl of dead bugs and grass like

 they were cereal and milk and crying while he did it;
  d.) Mr. Stenger had tried to strangle his wife with a stocking when the Red
 Sox lost a big ball game.
  Finally, too troubled to keep it to himself, he had asked Daddy about Mr.
 Stenger. His daddy had taken him on his lap and had explained that Mr. Stenger
 had been under a great deal of strain, some of it about his family and some
 about his job and some of it about things that nobody but doctors could
 understand. He had been having crying fits, and three nights ago he had gotten
 crying and couldn

s mother took him out of nursery school and they moved away
 from Stovington without Mr. Stenger.
  That had been over a year ago, after Daddy stopped taking the Bad Stuff but
 before he had lost his job. Danny still thought about it often. Sometimes when
 he fell down or bumped his head or had a bellyache, he would begin to cry and
 the memory would flash over him, accompanied by the fear that he would not be
 able to stop crying, that he would just go on and on, weeping and wailing, until
 his daddy went to the phone, dialed it, and said: "Hello? This is Jack Torrance

 And the gray truck with no windows would come rolling up to
 his door, they would load him in, still weeping hysterically, and take him away.
 When would he see his mommy and daddy again? NO ONE KNOWS.
  It was this fear that had kept him silent. A year older, he was quite sure
 that his daddy and mommy wouldn't let him be taken away for thinking a fire hose
 was a snake, his rational mind was sure of that, but still, when he thought of

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 telling them, that old memory rose up like a stone filling his mouth and
 blocking words. It wasn't like Tony; Tony had always seemed perfectly natural
 (until the bad dreams, of course), and his parents had also seemed to accept
 Tony as a more or less natural phenomenon. Things like Tony came from being
 BRIGHT, which they both assumed he was (the same way they assumed they were
 BRIGHT), but a fire hose that turned into a snake, or seeing blood and brains on
 the wall of the Presidential Sweet when no one else could, those things would
 not be natural. They had already taken him to see a regular doctor. Was it not
 reasonable to assume that THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS might come next?
  Still he might have told them except he was sure, sooner or later, that they
 would want to take him away from the hotel. And he wanted desperately to get
 away from the Overlook. But he also knew that this was his daddy's last chance,
 that he was here at the Overlook to do more than take care of the place. He was
 here to work on his papers. To get over losing his job. To love Mommy/Wendy. And
 until very recently, it had seemed that all those things were happening. It was
 only lately that Daddy had begun to have trouble. Since he found those papers.
  (This inhuman place makes human monsters.)
  What did that mean? He had prayed to God, but God hadn't told him. And what
 would Daddy do if he stopped working here? He had tried to find out from Daddy's
 mind, and had become more and more convinced that Daddy didn't know. The
 strongest proof had come earlier this evening when Uncle Al had called his daddy
 up on the phone and said mean things and Daddy didn't dare say anything back
 because Uncle Al could fire him from this job just the way that Mr. Crommert,
 the Stovington headmaster, and the Board of Directors had fired him from his
 schoolteaching job. And Daddy was scared to death of that, for him and Mommy as
 well as himself.
  So he didn't dare say anything. He could only watch helplessly and hope that
 there really weren't any Indians at all, or if there were that they would be
 content to wait for bigger game and let their little three-wagon train pass
 unmolested.
  But he couldn't believe it, no matter how hard he tried.
  Things were worse at the Overlook now.
  The snow was coming, and when it did, any poor options he had would be
 abrogated. And after the snow, what? What then, when they were shut in and at
 the mercy of whatever might have only been toying with them before?
  (Come out here and take your medicine!)
  What then? REDRUM.
  He shivered in his bed and turned over again. He could read more now. Tomorrow
 maybe he would try to call Tony, he would try to make Tony show him exactly what
 REDRUM was and if there was any way he could prevent it. He Would risk the
 nightmares. He had to know.
  Danny was still awake long after his parents' false sleep had become the real
 thing. He rolled in his bed, twisting the sheets, grappling with a problem years

 too big for him, awake in the night like a single sentinel on picket. And
 sometime after midnight, he slept too and then only the wind was awake, prying
 at the hotel and hooting in its gables under the bright gimlet gaze of the
 stars.

  Someone had added a very old Buick car radio under the hotel truck's

  Jack came out onto the porch, tugging the tab of his zipper up under his chin,
 blinking into the bright air. In his left hand he was holding a battery-powered

 hedge-clipper. He tugged a fresh handkerchief out of his back pocket with his
 right hand, wiped his lips with it, and tucked it away. Snow, they had said on
 the radio. It was hard to believe, even though he could see the clouds building
 up on the far horizon.
  He started down the path to the topiary, switching the hedge-clipper over to
 the other hand. It wouldn

Come on, come on,
t think the boy had been down half a
 dozen times, if that. He supposed if there had been another kid to play with, it
 would have been different.
  The gate squeaked slightly as he let himself in, and then there was crushed
 gravel crunching under his feet. He went first to the playhouse, the perfect
 scale model of the Overlook itself. It came up to his lower thigh, just about

t funny, either. You could open the
 house simply by pulling it apart--it opened on a hidden hinge. The inside was a
 disappointment. The walls were painted, but the place was mostly hollow. But of
 course it would have to be, he told himself, or how else could the kids get
 inside? What play furniture might go with the place in the summer was gone,
 probably packed away in the equipment shed. He closed it up and heard the small
 click as the latch closed.
  He walked over to the slide, set the hedge-clipper down, and after a glance
 back at the driveway to make sure Wendy and Danny hadn

 uncomfortably tight for his grownup ass. How long had it been since he had been

 Jack had taken his lumps when the old man was drunk, which was a lot of the
 time. But Jack had loved him for as long as he was able, long after the rest of
 the family could only hate and fear him.
  He pushed off with his hands and went to the bottom, but the trip was
 unsatisfying. The slide, unused, had too much friction and no really pleasant
 speed could be built up. And his ass was just too big. His adult feet thumped

  Everything was just as it had been. So why had the flesh of his face and hands
 begun to creep, and why bad the hair along the back of his neck begun to stand
 up, as if the flesh back there had suddenly tightened?
  He squinted up at the hotel again, but that was no answer. It simply stood
 there, its windows dark, a tiny thread of smoke curling from the chimney, coming
 from the banked fire in the lobby.

 the fucking rabbit, so what
s it)
  His breath stopped in his throat.
  The rabbit was down on all fours, cropping grass. Its belly was against the
 ground. But not ten minutes ago it had been up on its hind legs, of course it
 had been, he had trimmed its ears . . . and its belly.
  His eyes darted to the dog. When he had come down the path it had been sitting
 up, as if begging for a sweet. Now it was crouched, head tilted, the clipped
 wedge of mouth seeming to snarl silently. And the lions-
  (oh no, baby, oh no, uh-uh, no way)
  the lions were closer to the path. The two on his right had subtly changed
 positions, had drawn closer together. The tail of the one on the left now almost
 jutted out over the path. When he had come past them and through the gate, that
 lion had been on the right and he was quite sure its tail had been curled around
 it.
  They were no longer protecting the path; they were blocking it.
  Jack put his hand suddenly over his eyes and then took it away. The picture
 didn
re perfect.
  Another soft sound. He involuntarily backed up a step when he looked at the
 lions. One of the two on the right seemed to have drawn slightly ahead of the
 other. Its head was lowered. One paw had stolen almost all the way to the low
 fence. Dear God, what next?
  (next it leaps over and gobbles you up like something in an evil nursery
 fable)
  It was like that game they had played when they were kids, red light. One
 person was "it," and while he turned his back and counted to ten, the other
 players crept forward. When "it" got to ten, he whirled around and if he caught
 anyone moving, they were out of the game. The others remained frozen in statue
 postures until "it" turned his back and counted again. They got closer and

 closer, and at last, somewhere between five and ten, you would feel a hand on
 your back. . .
  Gravel rattled on the path.
  He jerked his head around to look at the dog and it was halfway down the
 pathway, just behind the lions now, its mouth wide and yawning. Before, it had
 only been a hedge clipped in the general shape of a dog, something that lost all
 definition when you got up close to it. But now Jack could see that it had been
 clipped to look like a German shepherd, and shepherds could be mean. You could
 train shepherds to kill.
  A low rustling sound.
  The lion on the left had advanced all the way to the fence now; its muzzle was
 touching the boards. It seemed to be grinning at him. Jack backed up another two
 steps. His head was thudding crazily and he could feel the dry rasp of his
 breath in his throat. Now the buffalo had moved, circling to the right, behind
 and around the rabbit. The head was lowered, the green hedge horns pointing at
 him. The thing was, you couldn
I'm very tired,
t
 seem crazy at all. "I
s all right."
  He began to trudge back up to the hotel. Part of his mind tugged fretfully at
 him, tried to make him detour around the hedge animals, but he went directly up
 the gravel path, through them. A faint breeze rattled through them, that was
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (160 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM

 Beyond the grounds the highway had disappeared under an even blanket of white.
 The hedge animals were also gone, but when Wendy and Danny had gotten home, she
 had commended him on the good job he had done. Do you think so? he had asked,
 and said no more. Now the hedges were buried under amorphous white cloaks.
  Curiously, all of them were thinking different thoughts but feeling the same
 emotion: relief. The bridge had been crossed.
  "Will it ever be spring?" Wendy murmured.
  Jack squeezed her tighter. "Before you know it. What do you say we go in and

  She smiled. All afternoon Jack had seemed distant and . . . well, odd. Now he
 sounded more like his normal self. 

  

  So they went in together, leaving the wind to build to the low-pitched scream
 that would go on all night-a sound they would get to know well. Flakes of snow
 swirled and danced across the porch. The Overlook faced it as it had for nearly
 three quarters of a century, its darkened windows now bearded with snow,
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (161 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:53 PM

 indifferent to the fact that it was now cut off from the world. Or possibly it
 was pleased with the prospect. Inside its shell the three of them went about
 their early evening routine, like microbes trapped in the intestine of a
 monster.

  A week and a half later two feet of snow lay white and crisp and even on the
 grounds of the Overlook Hotel. The hedge menagerie was buried up to its
 haunches; the rabbit, frozen on its hind legs, seemed to be rising from a white
 pool. Some of the drifts were over five feet deep. The wind was constantly
 changing them, sculpting them into sinuous, dunelike shapes. Twice Jack had
 snowshoed clumsily around to the equipment shed for his shovel to clear the
 porch, the third time he shrugged, simply cleared a path through the towering
 drift lying against the door, and let Danny amuse himself by sledding to the
 right and left of the path. The truly heroic drifts lay against the Overlook's
 west side; some of them towered to a height of twenty feet, and beyond them the
 ground was scoured bare to the grass by the constant windflow. The first-floor
 windows were covered, and the view from the dining room which Jack had so
 admired on closing day was now no more exciting than a view of a blank movie
 screen. Their phone had been out for the last eight days, and the CB radio in
 Ullman's office was now their only communications link with the outside world.
  It snowed every day now, sometimes only brief flurries that powdered the
 glittering snow crust, sometimes for real, the low whistle of the wind cranking
 up to a womanish shriek that made the old hotel rock and groan alarmingly even
 in its deep cradle of snow. Night temperatures had not gotten above 10°, and
 although the thermometer by the kitchen service entrance sometimes got as high
 as 25° in the early afternoons, the steady knife edge of the wind made it
 uncomfortable to go out without a ski mask. But they all did go out on the days
 when the sun shone, usually wearing two sets of clothing and mittens on over
 their gloves. Getting out was almost a compulsive thing; the hotel was circled
 with the double track of Danny's Flexible Flyer. The permutations were nearly
 endless: Danny riding while his parents pulled; Daddy riding and laughing while
 Wendy and Danny tried to pull (it was just possible for them to pull him on the
 icy crust, and flatly impossible when powder covered it); Danny and Mommy
 riding; Wendy riding by herself while her menfolk pulled and puffed white vapor

 like drayhorses, pretending she was heavier than she was. They laughed a great
 deal on these sled excursions around the house, but the whooping and impersonal
 voice of the wind, so huge and hollowly sincere, made their laughter seem tinny
 and forced.
  They had seen caribou tracks in the snow and once the caribou themselves, a
 group of five standing motionlessly below the security fence. They had all taken
 turns with Jack's Zeiss-Ikon binoculars to see them better, and looking at them
 had given Wendy a weird, unreal feeling: they were standing leg-deep in the snow
 that covered the highway, and it came to her that between now and the spring
 thaw, the road belonged more to the caribou than it did to them. Now the things
 that men had made up here were neutralized. The caribou understood that, she
 believed. She had put the binoculars down and had said something about starting
 lunch and in the kitchen she had cried a little, trying to rid herself of the
 awful pent-up feeling that sometimes fell on her like a large, pressing hand
 over her heart. She thought of the caribou. She thought of the wasps Jack had
 put out on the service entrance platform, under the Pyrex bowl, to freeze.
  There were plenty of snowshoes hung from nails in the equipment shed, and Jack
 found a pair to fit each of them, although Danny's pair was quite a bit
 outsized. Jack did well with them. Although he had not snowshoed since his
 boyhood in Berlin, New Hampshire, he retaught himself quickly. Wendy didn't care
 much for it--even fifteen minutes of tramping around on the outsized laced
 paddles made her legs and ankles ache outrageously-but Danny was intrigued and
 working hard to pick up the knack. He still fell often, but lack was pleased
 with his progress. He said that by February Danny would be skipping circles
 around both of them.
                                       * * *
  This day was overcast, and by noon the sky had already begun to spit snow. The
 radio was promising another eight to twelve inches and chanting hosannas to
 Precipitation, that great god of Colorado skiers. Wendy, sitting in the bedroom
 and knitting a scarf, thought to herself that she knew exactly what the skiers
 could do with all that snow. She knew exactly where they could put it.
  Jack was in the cellar. He had gone down to check the furnace and boiler--such
 checks had become a ritual with him since the snow had closed them in--and after
 satisfying himself that everything was going well he had wandered through the
 arch, screwed the lightbulb on, and had seated himself in an old and cobwebby
 camp chair he had found. He was leafing through the old records and papers,
 constantly wiping his mouth with his handkerchief as he did so. Confinement had
 leached his skin of its autumn tan, and as he sat hunched over the yellowed,
 crackling sheets, his reddish-blond hair tumbling untidily over his forehead, he
 looked slightly lunatic. He had found some odd things tucked in among the
 invoices, bills of lading, receipts. Disquieting things. A bloody strip of

 sheeting. A dismembered teddy bear that seemed to have been slashed to pieces. A
 crumpled sheet of violet ladies' stationery, a ghost of perfume still clinging
 to it beneath the musk of age, a note begun and left unfinished in faded blue
 ink: 
t think so well up here as I
ve had
 strange dreams about things going bump in the night, can you believe that and"
 That was all. The note was dated June 27, 1934. He found a hand puppet that
 seemed to be either a witch or a warlock . . . something with long teeth and a
 pointy hat, at any rate. It had been improbably tucked between a bundle of
 natural-gas receipts and a bundle of receipts for Vichy water. And something
 that seemed to be a poem, scribbled on the back of a menu in dark pencil:
 "Medoc/are you here?/I
 No date on the menu, and no name on the poem, if it was a
 poem. Elusive, but fascinating. It seemed to him that these things were like
 pieces in a jigsaw, things that would eventually fit together if he could find
 the right linking pieces. And so he kept looking, jumping and wiping his lips
 every time the furnace roared into life behind him.
                                       * * *
  Danny was standing outside Room 217 again.
  The passkey was in his pocket. He was staring at the door with a kind of
 drugged avidity, and his upper body seemed to twitch and jiggle beneath his
 flannel shirt. He was humming softly and tunelessly.
  He hadn't wanted to come here, not after the fire hose. He was scared to come
 here. He was scared that he had taken the passkey again, disobeying his father.
  He had wanted to come here. Curiosity
  (killed the cat; satisfaction brought him back)
  was like a constant fishhook in his brain, a kind of nagging siren song that
 would not be appeased. And hadn't Mr. Hallorann said,

  (You promised.)
  (Promises were made to be broken.)
  He jumped at that. It was as if that thought had come from outside, insectile,
 buzzing, softly cajoling.

  His nervous humming broke into low, atonal song:

 Presidential Sweet had been harmless, something old, something that had happened
 long before he was born or even thought of, something that was done with. Like a
 movie that only he could see. There was nothing, really nothing, in this hotel
 that could hurt him, and if he had to prove that to himself by going into this
 room, shouldn't he do so?

 stopped by the fire extinguisher, had put the brass nozzle back in the frame,
 and then had poked it repeatedly with his finger, heart thumping, whispering:

 He had felt insane with bravado. And nothing had happened. It
 was only a hose after all, only canvas and brass, you could hack it to pieces
 and it would never complain, never twist and jerk and bleed green slime all over
 the blue carpet, because it was only a hose, not a nose and not a rose, not
 glass buttons or satin bows, not a snake in a sleepy doze . . . and he had

  Danny pushed the door open. It swung smoothly, without a creak. He was
 standing just outside a large combination bedsitting room, and although the snow
 had not reached up this far-the highest drifts were still a foot below the

 second-floor windows-the room was dark because Daddy had closed all the shutters
 on the western exposure two weeks ago.
  He stood in the doorway, fumbled to his right, and found the switch plate. Two
 bulbs in an overhead cut-glass fixture came on. Danny stepped further in and
 looked around. The rug was deep and soft, a quiet rose color. Soothing. A double
 bed with a white coverlet. A writing desk
  (Pray tell me: Why is a raven like a writing desk?)
  by the large shuttered window. During the season the Constant Writer
  (having a wonderful time, wish you were fear)
  would have a pretty view of the mountains to describe to the folks back home.
  He stepped further in. Nothing here, nothing at all. Only an empty room, cold
 because Daddy was heating the east wing today. A bureau. A closet, its door open
 to reveal a clutch of hotel hangers, the kind you can
s where it was, whatever it was. In there. In the bathroom. His
 double walked forward, as if to escape the glass. It put its hand out, pressed
 it against his own. Then it fell away at an angle as the bathroom door swung
 open. He looked in.
  A long room, old-fashioned, like a Pullman car. Tiny white hexagonal tiles on
 the floor. At the far end, a toilet with the lid up. At the right, a washbasin
 and another mirror above it, the kind that hides a medicine cabinet. To the
 left, a huge white tub on claw feet, the shower curtain pulled closed. Danny
 stepped into the bathroom and walked toward the tub dreamily, as if propelled
 from outside himself, as if this whole thing were one of the dreams Tony had
 brought him, that he would perhaps see something nice when he pulled the shower
 curtain back, something Daddy had forgotten or Mommy had lost, something that
 would make them both happy-
  So he pulled the shower curtain back.
  The woman in the tub had been dead for a long time. She was bloated and
 purple, her gas-filled belly rising out of the cold, ice-rimmed water like some
 fleshy island. Her eyes were fixed on Danny

  His eyelids snapped down. His hands curled into balls. His shoulders hunched
 with the effort of his concentration:
  (Nothing there nothing there not there at all NOTHING

  Time passed. And he was just beginning to relax, just beginning to realize
 that the door must be unlocked and he could go, when the years-damp, bloated,
 fish-smelling hands closed softly around his throat and he was turned implacably
 around to stare into that dead and purple face.

  Knitting made her sleepy. Today even Bartok would have made her sleepy, and it
 wasn
s long
term resident, Wendy was asleep with her knitting on her lap. The yarn and
 needles rose in the slow time of her breathing. Her sleep was deep and she did
 not dream.
                                       * * *
  Jack Torrance had fallen asleep too, but his sleep was light and uneasy,
 populated by dreams that seemed too vivid to be mere dreams--they were certainly
 more vivid than any dreams he had ever had before.
  His eyes had begun to get heavy as he leafed through packets of milk bills, a
 hundred to a packet, seemingly tens of thousands all together. Yet he gave each
 one a cursory glance, afraid that by not being thorough he might miss exactly
 the piece of Overlookiana he needed to make the mystic connection that he was
 sure must be here somewhere. He felt like a man with a power cord in one hand,
 groping around a dark and unfamiliar room for a socket. If he could find it he
 would be rewarded with a view of wonders.
  He had come to grips with Al Shockley
s high-goddam-handed request that he chuck his book
 project. It had maybe been a signal that his own sense of self-respect could
 only be pushed so far before disintegrating entirely. He would write the book.
 If it meant the end of his association with Al Shockley, that would have to be.
 He would write the hotel
t.
 Three hundred pts orange juice. Pd.
  He slipped down further in his chair, still holding a clutch of the receipts,
 but his eyes no longer looking at what was printed there. They had come
 unfocused. His lids were slow and heavy. His mind had slipped from the Overlook
 to his father, who had been a male nurse at the Berlin Community Hospital. Big
 man. A fat man who had towered to six feet two inches, he had been taller than
 Jack even when Jack got his full growth of six feet even--not that the old man
 had still been around then. "Runt of the litter," he would say, and then cuff
 Jack lovingly and laugh. There had been two other brothers, both taller than
 their father, and Becky, who at five-ten had only been two inches shorter than
 Jack and taller than he for most of their childhood.
  His relationship with his father had been like the unfurling of some flower of
 beautiful potential, which, when wholly opened, turned out to be blighted
 inside. Until he had been seven he had loved the tall, big-bellied man
 uncritically and strongly in spite of the spankings, the black-and-blues, the
 occasional black eye.
  He could remember velvet summer nights, the house quiet, oldest brother Brett
 out with his girl, middle brother Mike studying something, Becky and their
 mother in the living room, watching something on the balky old TV; and he would
 sit in the hall dressed in a pajama singlet and nothing else, ostensibly playing
 with his trucks, actually waiting for the moment when the silence would be
 broken by the door swinging open with a large bang, the bellow of his father
Elevator! Elevator!
s flattopped head like a human
 projectile to crash-land on the hall floor behind his dad. But on other nights
 his father would only sweep him into a giggling ecstasy, through the zone of air
 where beer hung around his father
s image tattooed on their backs like stereopticon images, opened a little
 bit and then slipped back down again. He twitched a little. Consciousness, like
 the receipts, like autumn aspen leaves, seesawed lazily downward.
  That had been the first phase of his relationship with his father, and as it
 was drawing to its end he had become aware that Becky and his brothers, all of
 them older, hated the father and that their mother, a nondescript woman who
 rarely spoke above a mutter, only suffered him because her Catholic upbringing
 said that she must. In those days it had not seemed strange to Jack that the
 father won all his arguments with his children by use of his fists, and it had
 not seemed strange that his own love should go hand-in-hand with his fear: fear
 of the elevator game which might end in a splintering crash on any given night;
 fear that his father
good right hand
s shadow might fall over him
 while he was at play. It was near the end of this phase that he began to notice
 that Brett never brought his dates home, or Mike and Becky their chums.
  Love began to curdle at nine, when his father put his mother into the hospital
 with his cane. He had begun to carry the cane a year earlier, when a car
 accident had left him lame. After that he was never without it, long and black
 and thick and gold-headed. Now, dozing, Jack

s spectacles dropped into her gravy. The cane had
 been drawn back, had come down again, this time on top of her head, splitting
 the scalp. Momma had dropped to the floor. He had been out of his chair and
 around to where she lay dazed on the carpet, brandishing the cane, moving with a
 fat man

 over a party line he couldn

 the dining room. The four children had been stunned to silence by the calm
 stupendousness of the lie. Four days later Brett quit his job in the mill and
 joined the Army. Jack had always felt it was not just the sudden and irrational
 beating his father had administered at the dinner table but the fact that, in
 the hospital, their mother had corroborated their father

  The stone read Mark Anthony Torrance, Loving Father. To that Jack would have
 added one line: He Knew How to Play Elevator.
  There had been a great lot of insurance money. There are people who collect

 had been that type. The insurance money came in at the same time the monthly
 policy payments and liquor bills stopped. For five years they had been rich.
 Nearly rich . . .
  In his shallow, uneasy sleep his face rose before him as if in a glass, his
 face but not his face, the wide eyes and innocent bowed mouth of a boy sitting
 in the ball with his trucks, waiting for his daddy, waiting for the white ghost
god, waiting for the elevator to rise up with dizzying, exhilarating speed
 through the salt-and-sawdust mist of exhaled taverns, waiting perhaps for it to
 go crashing down, spilling old clocksprings out of his ears while his daddy

  and the big two-way radio on its shelf.
  He snapped it on. CB transmissions coming in short, crackly bursts. He
 switched the band and dialed across bursts of music, news, a preacher haranguing
 a softly moaning congregation, a weather report. And another voice which he
 dialed back to. It was his father
--kill him. You have to kill him, Jacky, and her, too. Because a real artist
 must suffer. Because each man kills the thing he loves. Because they'll always
 be conspiring against you, trying to hold you back and drag you down. Right this

 Because he had cut all the father out of him and it was not right that
 he should come back creeping through this hotel two thousand miles from the New
 England town where his father had lived and died.
  He raised the radio up and brought it down, and it smashed on the floor
 spilling old clocksprings and tubes like the result of some crazy elevator game
 gone awry, making his father's voice gone, leaving only his voice, Jack's voice,
 Jacky's voice, chanting in the cold reality of the office:

  And the startled sound of Wendy's feet hitting the floor over his head, and
 Wendy's startled, frightened voice: 

  He stood, blinking down at the shattered radio. Now there was only the
 snowmobile in the equipment shed to link them to the outside world.
  He put his hands over his eyes and clutched at his temples. He was getting a
 headache.

                                   CATATONIC
  Wendy ran down the hall in her stocking feet and ran down the main stairs to
 the lobby two at a time. She didn't look up at the carpeted flight that led to
 the second floor, but if she had, she would have seen Danny standing at the top
 of them, still and silent, his unfocused eyes directed out into indifferent
 space, his thumb in his mouth, the collar and shoulders of his shirt damp. There
 were puffy bruises on his neck and just below his chin.
  Jack's cries had ceased, but that did nothing to ease her fear. Ripped out of
 her sleep by his voice, raised in that old hectoring pitch she remembered so
 well, she still felt that she was dreaming--but another part knew she was awake,
 and that terrified her more. She half-expected to burst into the office and find
 him standing over Danny's sprawled-out body, drunk and confused.
  She pushed through the door and Jack was standing there, rubbing at his
 temples with his fingers. His face was ghostwhite. The two-way CB radio lay at
 his feet in a sprinkling of broken glass.
  
 he asked uncertainly. 

  The bewilderment seemed to grow and for a moment she saw his true face, the
 one he ordinarily kept so well hidden, and it was a face of desperate
 unhappiness, the face of an animal caught in a snare beyond its ability to
 decipher and render harmless. Then the muscles began to work, began to writhe
 under the skin, the mouth began to tremble infirmly, the Adam's apple began to
 rise and fall.
  Her own bewilderment and surprise were overlaid by shock: he was going to cry.
 She had seen him cry before, but never since he stopped drinking . . . and never
 in those days unless he was very drunk and pathetically remorseful. He was a
 tight man, drum-tight, and his loss of control frightened her all over again.
  He came toward her, the tears brimming over his lower lids now, his head
 shaking involuntarily as if in a fruitless effort to ward off this emotional
 storm, and his chest drew in a convulsive gasp that was expelled in a huge,
 racking sob. His feet, clad in Hush Puppies, stumbled over the wreck of the
 radio and he almost fell into her arms, making her stagger back with his weight.
 His breath blew into her face and there was no smell of liquor on it. Of course
 not; there was no liquor up here.
  
s wrong?" She held him as best she could. "Jack, what is it?"
  But he could do nothing at first but sob, clinging to her, almost crushing the
 wind from her, his head turning on her shoulder in that helpless, shaking,
 warding-off gesture. His sobs were heavy and fierce. He was shuddering all over,
 his muscles jerking beneath his plaid shirt and jeans.
  "Jack? What? Tell me what

  At last the sobs began to change themselves into words, most of them
 incoherent at first, but coming clearer as his tears began to spend themselves.

  She turned and walked out the door.
  He watched her go, frozen for a moment, a blotter covered with fragments of
 broken glass in one hand. Then he dropped it into the wastebasket, went after
 her, and caught her by the lobby desk. He put his hands on her shoulders and
 turned her around. Her face was carefully set.
  "Wendy, I
m upset. Forgive?"
  "Of course," she said, her face not changing expression. Her wooden shoulders
 slipped out of his hands. She walked to the middle of the lobby and called:
 "Hey, doc! Where are you?"
  Silence came back. She walked toward the double lobby doors opened one of
 them, and stepped out onto the path Jack had shoveled. It was more like a
 trench; the packed and drifted snow through which the path was cut came to her
 shoulders. She called him again, her breath coming out in a white plume. When

  "Did you look in his room when you came downstairs just now?"

  He started up the stairs without waiting for her. She followed him, half
running, but he was taking the risers two at a time. She almost crashed into his
 back when he came to a dead stop on the first-floor landing. He was rooted
 there, looking up, his eyes wide.
  
 she began, and followed his gaze.
  Danny still stood there, his eyes blank, sucking his thumb. The marks on his
 throat were cruelly visible in the light of the hall's electric flambeaux.
  
 she shrieked.
  It broke Jack's paralysis and they rushed up the stairs together to where he
 stood. Wendy fell on her knees beside him and swept the boy into her arms. Danny
 came pliantly enough, but he did not hug her back. It was like hugging a padded
 stick, and the sweet taste of horror flooded her mouth. He only sucked his thumb
 and stared with indifferent blankness out into the stairwell beyond both of
 them.
  
 Jack asked. He put out his hand to touch the puffy
 side of Danny's neck. 
Don't you touch him!
What? Wendy, what the hell are you t--
Don't you touch him! I'll kill you if you lay your hands on him again!
Wendy--
You bastard!
s
 head jounced mildly up and down as she ran. His thumb was lodged securely in his
 mouth. His eyes were soaped windows. She turned right at the foot of the stairs,
 and Jack heard her feet retreat to the end of it. Their bedroom door slammed.
 The bolt was run home. The lock turned. Brief silence. Then the soft, muttered
 sounds of comforting.
  He stood for an unknown length of time, literally paralyzed by all that had
 happened in such a short space of time. His dream was still with him, painting
 everything a slightly unreal shade. It was as if he had taken a very mild
 mescaline hit. Had he maybe hurt Danny as Wendy thought? Tried to strangle his

t even shift toward the door when Jack cried out "No!" somewhere in the
 hallway.
  The confusion had receded a little bit in her mind, but she now discovered
 something even worse behind it. Panic.
  Jack had done this, she had no doubt of it. His denials meant nothing to her.
 She thought it was perfectly possible that Jack had tried to throttle Danny in
 his sleep just as he had smashed the CB radio in his sleep. He was having a
 breakdown of some kind. But what was she going to do about it? She couldn

 office in Sidewinder. She had no particular need to see further. The present
 crisis was more than enough to keep her occupied.
  She crooned to Danny, rocking him on her breasts. Her fingers, on his
 shoulder, had noticed that his T-shirt was damp, but they had not bothered
 reporting the information to her brain in more than a cursory way. If it had
 been reported, she might have remembered that Jack
s reach. She was aware now that she had made
 one bad decision when she had gone against her feelings (and Danny
s sake. Another bad decision
 when she had shelved the idea of divorce. Now she was nearly paralyzed by the
 idea that she might be making another mistake, one she would regret every minute
 of every day of the rest of her life.
  There was not a gun in the place. There were knives hanging from the
 magnetized runners in the kitchen, but Jack was between her and them.
  In her striving to make the right decision, to find the alternative, the
 bitter irony of her thoughts did not occur: an hour ago she had been asleep,
 firmly convinced that things were all right and soon would be even better. Now
 she was considering the possibility of using a butcher knife on her husband if
 he tried to interfere with her and her son.
  At last she stood up with Danny in her arms, her legs trembling. There was no
 other way. She would have to assume that Jack awake was Jack sane, and that he
 would help her get Danny down to Sidewinder and Dr. Edmonds. And if Jack tried
 to do anything but help, God help him.
  She went to the door and unlocked it. Shifting Danny up to her shoulder, she
 opened it and went out into the hall.
  "Jack?" she called nervously, and got no answer.
  With growing trepidation she walked down to the stairwell, but Jack was not
 there. And as she stood there on the landing, wondering what to do next, the
 singing came up from below, rich, angry, bitterly satiric:
    "Roll me over
    In the clo-ho-ver,
    Roll me over, lay me down and do it again."
  She was frightened even more by the sound of him than she had been by his
 silence, but there was still no alternative. She started down the stairs.

  Jack had stood on the stairs, listening to the crooning, comforting sounds
 coming muffled through the locked door, and slowly his confusion had given way
 to anger. Things had never really changed. Not to Wendy. He could be off the
 juice for twenty years and still when he came home at night and she embraced him
 at the door, he would see/ sense that little flare of her nostrils as she tried
 to divine scotch or gin fumes riding the outbound train of his exhalation. She
 was always going to assume the worst; if he and Danny got in a car accident with
 a drunken blindman who .had had a stroke just before the collision, she would
 silently blame Danny
s arm had been a terrible thing. But if a man reforms, doesn
t get it,
 doesn
d have to come out, unless she planned a radical
 sort of diet for the two of them. A rather ugly grin touched his lips at the
 thought. Let her come to him. She would in time.
  He went downstairs to the ground floor, stood aimlessly by the lobby desk for
 a moment, then turned right. He went into the dining room and stood just inside
 the door. The empty tables, their white linen cloths neatly cleaned and pressed
 beneath their clear plastic covers, glimmered up at him. All was deserted now
 but

  Jack walked among the tables, momentarily forgetting his wife and son
 upstairs, forgetting the dream, the smashed radio, the bruises. He trailed his
 fingers over the slick plastic dustcovers, trying to imagine how it must have

 been on that
  hot August night in 1945, the war won, the future stretching ahead so various
 and new, like a land of dreams. The bright and particolored Japanese lanterns
 hung the whole length of the circular drive, the golden-yellow light spilling
 from these high windows that were now drifted over with snow. Men
  and women in costume, here a glittering princess, there a high-booted
 cavalier, flashing jewelry and flashing wit every
  where, dancing, liquor flowing freely, first wine and then cocktails and then
 perhaps boilermakers the level of conver
  sation going up and up and up until the jolly cry rang out from the
 bandmaster

re on the house.)
  He stepped through the batwings and into the deep, folded shadows of the bar.
 And a strange thing occurred. He had been in here before, once to check the
 inventory sheet Ullman had left, and he knew the place had been stripped clean.
 The shelves were totally bare. But now, lit only murkily by the light which
 filtered through from the dining room (which was itself only dimly lit because
 of the snow blocking the windows), he thought he saw ranks and ranks of bottles
 twinkling mutedly behind the bar, and syphons, and even beer dripping from the
 spigots of all three highly polished taps. Yes, he could even smell beer, that
 damp and fermented and yeasty odor, no different from the smell that had hung
 finely misted around his father

cushioned edge. At his left hand was a bowl for peanuts-now empty, of course.

 would you believe it? And I thought they had Seven-Elevens on the fucking moon."
  Lloyd sympathized.

  Lloyd said he wasn
Good man. You line those martians up right along the bar and I'm going to

I seem to be momentarily light,

 anyhow?
That's super. I like you, Lloyd. You were always the best of them. Best

 matter.

 down the short length of the room. Padded leather seats and backs. Gleaming dark
 Formica tables, an ashtray on each one, a book of matches in each ashtray, the
 words Colorado Lounge stamped on each in gold leaf above the batwing-door logo.
  He turned back, swallowing the rest of the dissolving Excedrin with a grimace.
  "Lloyd, you
 he said. 

  Jack contemplated the twenty imaginary drinks, the martini glasses blushing
 droplets of condensation, each with a swizzle poked through a plump green olive.
 He could almost smell gin on the air.
  
 he said. 

  Lloyd allowed as how he had met such men from time to time.
  

  Lloyd could not, in all honesty, recall.
  
 Jack said. He curled his hand around the first drink,
 carried his fist to his mouth, which was open, and turned his fist up. He
 swallowed and then tossed the imaginary glass over his shoulder. The people were
 back again, fresh from their costume ball, studying him, laughing behind their
 hands. He could feel them. If the backbar had featured a mirror instead of those
 damn stupid empty shelves, he could have seen them. Let them stare. Fuck them.
 Let anybody stare who wanted to stare.
  
 he told Lloyd.

 flashing their panties at you. Man, you got to get on that Wagon and away from
 the juicers that are straining canned heat and smelling their own puke to get
 high again and poking along the gutter for butts with half an inch left below
 the filter."
  He drained two more imaginary drinks and tossed the glasses back over his
 shoulder. He could almost hear them smashing on the floor. And goddam if he

  He stopped. Lloyd was gone. Worse still, he had never been there. The drinks
 had never been there. Only the people in the booths, the people from the costume
 party, and he could almost hear their muffled laughter as they held their bands
 to their mouths and pointed, their eyes sparkling with cruel pinpoints of light.
  He whirled around again. 

  (alone?)
  All the booths were empty. The sound of laughter had died like a stir of
 autumn leaves. Jack stared at the empty lounge for a tick of time, his eyes wide
 and dark. A pulse beat noticeably in the center of his forehead. In the very
 center of him a cold certainty was forming and the certainty was that he was
 losing his mind. He felt an urge to pick up the bar stool next to him, reverse
 it, and go through the place like an avenging whirlwind. Instead he whirled back
 around to the bar and began to bellow:
    

  Danny's face rose before him, not Danny's normal face, lively and alert, the
 eyes sparkling and open, but the catatonic, zombielike face of a stranger, the
 eyes dull and opaque, the mouth pursed babyishly around his thumb. What was he

 doing, sitting here and talking to himself like a sulky teen-ager when his son
 was upstairs, someplace, acting like something that belonged in a padded room,
 acting the way Wally Hollis said Vic Stenger had been before the men in the
 white coats had to come and take him away?
  (But 1 never put a hand on him! Goddammit, 1 didn't!)
  
 The voice was timid, hesitant.
  He was so startled he almost fell off the stool whirling it around. Wendy was
 standing just inside the batwing doors, Danny cradled in her arms like some
 waxen horror show dummy. The three of them made a tableau that Jack felt very
 strongly; it was just before the curtain of Act II in some oldtime temperance
 play, one so poorly mounted that the prop man had forgotten to stock the shelves
 of the Den of Iniquity.
  
 Jack said thickly. 

  
t matter now. What matters is-"
  "This matters!" he shouted. He brought one fist crashing down on the bar, hard
 enough to make the empty peanut dishes jump. "It matters, goddammit, it matters!

  "Jack, we have to get him off the mountain. He

  Danny began to stir in her arms. The slack, empty expression on his face had
 begun to break up like a thick matte of ice over some buried surface. His lips
 twisted, as if at some weird taste. His eyes widened. His hands came up as if to
 cover them and then dropped back.
  Abruptly he stiffened in her arms. His back arched into a bow, making Wendy
 stagger. And he suddenly began to shriek, mad sounds that escaped his straining
 throat in bolt after crazy, echoing bolt. The sound seemed to fill the empty
 downstairs and come back at them like banshees. There might have been a hundred
 Dannys, all screaming at once.
  
 she cried in terror. 
s wrong with him?"
  He came off the stool, numb from the waist down, more frightened than he had
 ever been in his life. What hole had his son poked through and into? What dark
 nest? And what had been in there to sting him?
  "Danny!" he roared. "Danny!"
  Danny saw him. He broke his mother
Daddy!
Oh Daddy
 Daddy, it was her! Her! Her! Oh Daaaaahdeee--
s arms like a blunt arrow, making Jack rock on his feet.
 Danny clutched at him furiously, at first seeming to pummel him like a fighter,
 then clutching his belt and sobbing against his shirt. Jack could feel his son
s face. His eyes were like small silver
 coins.
  "Wendy?" Voice soft, nearly purring. "Wendy, what did you do to him?"
  Wendy stared back at him in stunned disbelief, her face pallid. She shook her
 head.
  "Oh Jack, you must know--"
  Outside it had begun to snow again.
                                   << 29 >>
                                 KITCHEN TALK
  Jack carried Danny into the kitchen. The boy was still sobbing wildly,
 refusing to look up from Jack
Jack, I don't know what he's talking about. Please, you must believe that.
I do believe it,
Got cooking sherry, don't you?
What? . . . oh, sure. Two or three bottles of it.
Which cupboard?
Want you to drink this, doc,
It's going to taste frigging awful,
 but it'll make you feel better. Can you drink it for your daddy?
t
 you watching her? What kind of a father are you?
  (She had hounded him to his grave; by the time he divorced her it was too
 late.)
  She had never even given Jack the benefit of the doubt. Not the smallest.
 Wendy felt her face burn yet knew with a kind of helpless finality that if the
 whole thing were to be played over again, she would do and think the same way.
 She carried part of her mother with her always, for good or bad.
  "Jack--" she began, not sure if she meant to apologize or justify. Either, she
 knew, would be useless.
  "Not now," he said.
  It took Danny fifteen minutes to drink half of the big cup
s shoulders. "Danny, do you think you
 can tell us exactly what happened to you? It

  Danny looked from Jack to Wendy, then back again. In the silent pause, their
 setting and situation made themselves known: the whoop of the wind outside,
 driving fresh snow down from the northwest; the creaking and groaning of the old
 hotel as it settled into another storm. The fact of their disconnect came to
 Wendy with unexpected force as it sometimes did, like a blow under the heart.
  
 Danny said. 
 He
 picked up the cup and held it, as if comforted by the warmth.
  
t you, son?" Jack brushed Danny
Because Uncle Al got you the job. And I couldn't figure out how it was good
 for you here and bad for you here at the same time. It was . . .
A dilemma?
When neither choice seems any good?
Yes, that.
The day that you trimmed the hedges, Danny and I had a talk in
 the truck. The day the first real snow came. Remember?
I guess we didn't talk enough. Did we, doc?
Exactly what did you talk about?
I'm not sure how much I like
 my wife and son--
--discussing how much they love you?
Whatever it was, I don't understand it. I feel like I came into a movie just
 after the intermission.
We were discussing you,
And maybe we didn't say it all
 in words, but we both knew. Me because I'm your wife and Danny because he . . .
 just understands things.
Danny said it just right. The place seemed good for you. You were away from
 all the pressures that made you so unhappy at Stovington. You were your own
 boss, working with your hands so you could save your brain--all of your brain-
for your evenings writing. Then . . . I don't know just when . . . the place
 began to seem bad for you. Spending all that time down in the cellar, sifting
 through those old papers, all that old history. Talking in your sleep--
In my sleep?
I
 talk in my sleep?
Most of it is slurry. Once I got up to use the bathroom and you were saying,
 'To hell with it, bring in the slots at least, no one will know, no one will
 ever know.' Another time you woke me right up, practically yelling, `Unmask,
 unmask, unmask.

 around."
  "What was it?" Jack asked.
  "In the Presidential Sweet. On the wall by the door going into the bedroom. A
 whole lot of blood and some other stuff. Gushy stuff. I think . . . that the
 gushy stuff must have been brains."
  "Oh my God," Jack said.
  Wendy was now very pale, her lips nearly gray.
  "This place," Jack said. "Some pretty bad types owned it awhile back.
 Organization people from Las Vegas."
  "Crooks?" Danny asked.
  "Yeah, crooks." He looked at Wendy. "In 1966 a big-time hood named Vito
 Gienelli got killed up there, along with his two bodyguards. There was a picture
 in the newspaper. Danny just described the picture."

  "Mr. Hallorann said he saw some other stuff," Danny told them. "Once about the
 playground. And once it was something bad in that room. 217. A maid saw it and
 lost her job because she talked about it. So Mr. Hallorann went up and he saw it
 too. But he didn

 he told me never to go in there. But I did. Because I believed him when he said

 This last was nearly whispered in a
 low, husky voice, and Danny touched the puffed circle of bruises on his neck.
  
 Jack asked in a strange, casual voice.
  
t know. The playground, he said. And the hedge animals."
  Jack jumped a little, and Wendy looked at him curiously.
  "Have you seen anything down there, Jack?"
  "No," he said. "Nothing."
  Danny was looking at him.
  "Nothing," he said again, more calmly. And that was true. He had been the
 victim of an hallucination. And that was all.
  "Danny, we have to hear about the woman," Wendy said gently.
  So Danny told them, but his words came in cyclic bursts, sometimes almost
 verging on incomprehensible garble in his hurry to spit it out and be free of
 it. He pushed tighter and tighter against his mother
I went in,
I stole the passkey and went in. It was like I couldn't

 dead. All swelled up. She was nuh-nuh . . . didn't have no clothes on.
And she started to get up and she wanted me. I

 and Daddy think. It was black . . . it was hurt-think . . . like . . . like the
 wasps that night in my room! Only wanting to hurt. Like the wasps.
So I ran,
I ran but the door was closed. I left it open but it
 was closed. I didn't think about just opening it again and running out. I was
 scared. So I just . . . I leaned against the door and closed my eyes and thought
 of how Mr. Hallorann said the things here were just like pictures in a book and

  He took the elevator up and it was strange, because none of them had used the
 elevator since they moved in. He threw the brass handle over and it wheezed
 vibratoriously up the shaft, the brass grate rattling madly. Wendy had a true
 claustrophobe
t that at least his just deserts?
  He walked down to the door, removed the passkey, dropped it into his pocket,
 and stepped inside. The overhead light was on. He glanced at the bed, saw it was
 not rumpled, and then walked directly across to the bathroom door. A curious
 certainty had grown in him. Although Watson had mentioned no names or room
 numbers, Jack felt sure that this was the room the lawyer

  There was a sudden rattling, metallic sound behind him. It came just as his
 hand closed around the doorknob, and an observer might have thought the brushed
 steel of the knob carried an electric charge. He jerked convulsively, eyes

 widening, other facial features drawing in, grimacing.
  Then he had control of himself, a little, anyway, and he let 90 of the
 doorknob and turned carefully around. His joints creaked. He began to walk back
 to the bathroom door, step by leaden step.
  The shower curtain, which he had pushed back to look into the tub, was now
 drawn. The metallic rattle, which had sounded to him like a stir of bones in a
 crypt, had been the curtain rings on the overhead bar. Jack stared at the
 curtain. His face felt as if it had been heavily waxed, all dead skin on the
 outside, live, hot rivulets of fear on the inside. The way he had felt on the
 playground.
  There was something behind the pink plastic shower curtain. There was
 something in the tub.
  He could see it, ill defined and obscure through the plastic, a nearly
 amorphous shape. It could have been anything. A trick of the light. The shadow
 of the shower attachment. A woman long dead and reclining in her bath, a bar of
 Lowila in one stiffening hand as she waited patiently for whatever lover might
 come.
  Jack told himself to step forward boldly and rake the shower curtain back. To
 expose whatever might be there. Instead he turned with jerky, marionette
 strides, his heart whamming frightfully in his chest, and went back into the
 bed/sitting room.
  The door to the hall was shut.
  He stared at it for a long, immobile second. He could taste his terror now. It
 was in the back of his throat like a taste of gone-over cherries.
  He walked to the door with that same jerky stride and forced his fingers to
 curl around the knob.

  "No," he whimpered, hardly aware that he had been reduced to this, whimpering
 with his eyes shut like a child. "Oh no, God. Please, God, no."
  But below the tumble of his chaotic thoughts, below the triphammer beat of his
 heart, he could hear the soft and futile sound of the doorknob being turned to
 and fro as something locked in tried helplessly to get out, something that
 wanted to meet him, something that would like to be introduced to his family as
 the storm shrieked around them and white daylight became black night. If he
 opened his eyes and saw that doorknob moving he would go mad. So he kept them
 shut, and after an unknowable time, there was stillness.
  Jack forced himself to open his eyes, half-convinced that when he did, she
 would be standing before him. But the hall was empty.
  He felt watched just the same.
  He looked at the peephole in the center of the door and wondered what would

  He stepped into the kitchen and looked at them, bouncing the passkey a few
 inches up off his left hand, making the chain on the white metal tongue jingle,
 then catching it again. Danny was pallid and worn out. Wendy had been crying, he
 saw; her eyes were red and darkly circled. He felt a sudden burst of gladness at

 And we
Don't wake him up, Jack. Please.
Okay.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry I sounded mad, Wendy. It's not really for you. But I broke
 the radio. If it's anybody's fault it's mine. That was our big link to the
 outside. Olly-oily-in-for-free. Please come get us, Mister Ranger. We can't stay

Yes,
But it's not just you. I worry
 when he goes out to play. I worry about him wanting a two-wheeler next year,
 even one with training wheels. I worry about his teeth and his eyesight and
 about this thing, what he calls his shine. I worry. Because he's little and he
 seems very fragile and because . . . because something in this hotel seems to
 want him. And it will go through us to get him if it has to. That's why we must

t move away. One hand found the firm weight of her left breast and he began
 to stroke it through her shirt.
  "Wendy," he said, and stopped. She waited for him to rearrange whatever he had
 to say. His strong hand on her breast felt good, soothing. "I could maybe
 snowshoe him down. He could walk part of the way himself, but I would mostly
 have to carry him. It would mean camping out one, two, maybe three nights. That
 would mean building a travois to carry supplies and bedrolls on. We have the
 AM/FM radio, so we could pick a day when the weather forecast called for a
 three-day spell of good weather. But if the forecast was wrong," he finished,
 his voice soft and measured, "I think we might die."

 her breast, rubbing the ball of his thumb gently over the nipple.
  She made a soft sound--from his words or in reaction to his gentle pressure on
 her breast, he couldn

  He raised his head slightly to answer and then settled his mouth against the

  "If the helicopter was spoken for I guess it would have to be by snowmobile."

  "But we have one of those! Ullman said so!"
  His mouth froze against her breast for a moment, and then he sat up. Her own

Wendy, I've never driven a snowmobile in my life.
It can't be that hard to learn. Back in Vermont you see ten-year-olds driving

 There's gas for the emergency generator downstairs, too. And there must be a

  The bitter lock of his emotions was broken. He got out of bed and went across

t be that way again. He would be
 able to handle his responsibilities much better. He was sure of it.
  Somewhere in the midst of that thought, things began to break up and he
 drifted down into sleep. His last thought followed him down like a sounding
 bell:
  It seemed that he might be able to find peace here. At last. If they would
 only let him.
                                     * * *
  When he woke up he was standing in the bathroom of 217.
  (been walking in my sleep again--why?--no radios to break up here)
  The bathroom light was on, the room behind him in darkness. The shower curtain
 was drawn around the long claw-footed tub. The bathmat beside it was wrinkled
 and wet.
  He began to feel afraid, but the very dreamlike quality of his fear told him
 this was not real. Yet that could not contain the fear. So many things at the
 Overlook seemed like dreams.
  He moved across the floor to the tub, not wanting to be helpless to turn his
 feet back.
  He flung the curtain open.
  Lying in the tub, naked, lolling almost weightless in the water, was George
 Hatfield, a knife stuck in his chest. The water around him was stained a bright
 pink. George

  "You did! You did cheat!" he screamed in fear and anger as he crossed the
 darkened bed/sitting room. "I

  George's hands were on his neck again. Jack's heart swelled with fear until he
 was sure it would burst. And then, at last, his hand curled around the doorknob
 and it turned under his hand and he yanked the door open. He plunged out, not
 into the second-floor hallway, but into the basement room beyond the arch. The
 cobwebby light was on. His campchair, stark and geometrical, stood beneath it.
 And all around it was a miniature mountain range of boxes and crates and banded
 bundles of records and invoices and God knew what. Relief surged through him.

 cardboard box; it split apart in his hands, spilling out a waterfall of yellow
 flimsies. "It

 the pile of papers and came up with a dry, papery wasps' nest in one hand and a

 dynamite. 
 he screamed. 

  His relief became absolute triumph. He had done more than escape George,; be

 touch him again. George would flee in terror.
  He began to turn so he could confront George, and that was when George's hands
 settled around his neck, squeezing, stopping his breath, damming up his
 respiration entirely after one final dragging gasp.

 again, this time in a whisper.
  "No. No, Danny. Never."
  He went back to bed on legs that had turned to rubber. Wendy was sleeping
 deeply. The clock on the nightstand said it was quarter to five. He lay
 sleepless until seven, when Danny began to stir awake. Then he put his legs over
 the edge of the bed and began to dress. It was time to go downstairs and check
 the boiler.

  Sometime after midnight, while they all slept uneasily, the snow had stopped
 after dumping a fresh eight inches on the old crust. The clouds had broken, a
 fresh wind had swept them away, and now Jack stood in a dusty ingot of sunlight,
 which slanted through the dirty window set into the eastern side of the
 equipment shed.
  The place was about as long as a freight car, and about as high. It smelled of
 grease and oil and gasoline and--faint, nostalgic smell--sweet grass. Four power
 lawnmowers were ranked like soldiers on review against the south wall, two of
 them the riding type that look like small tractors. To their left were posthole
 diggers, round-bladed shovels made for doing surgery on the putting green, a
 chain saw, the electric hedge-clippers, and a long thin steel pole with a red
 flag at the top. Caddy, fetch my ball in under ten seconds and there

 the side of the engine cowling facing him in black letters which had been raked
 backward, presumably to connote speed. The protruding skis were also black.
 There was black piping to the right and left of the cowling, what they would
 call racing stripes on a sports car. But the actual paintjob was a bright,
 sneering yellow, and that was what he didn

 colors, at least. Because after it had done its job, they were going to be
 hurting plenty. All of them. By spring the Torrance family would be hurting so
 badly that what those wasps had done to Danny
s
 kisses.
  He pulled his handkerchief from his back pocket, wiped his mouth with it, and
 walked over to the Skidoo. He stood looking down at it, the frown very deep now,
 and stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket. Outside a sudden gust of wind
 slammed against the equipment shed, making it rock and creak. He looked out the
 window and saw the gust carrying a sheet of sparkling snow crystals toward the
 drifted-in rear of the hotel, whirling them high into the hard blue sky.
  The wind dropped and be went back to looking at the machine. It was a
 disgusting thing, really. You almost expected to see a long, limber stinger
 protruding from the rear of it. He had always disliked the goddam snowmobiles.
 They shivered the cathedral silence of winter into a million rattling fragments.
 They startled the wildlife. They sent out huge and pollutive clouds of blue and
 billowing oilsmoke behind them--cough, cough, gag, gag, let me breathe. They
 were perhaps the final grotesque toy of the unwinding fossil fuel age, given to
 ten-year-olds for Christmas.
  He remembered a newspaper article he had read in Stovington, a story datelined
 someplace in Maine. A kid on a snowmobile, barrel-assing up a road he

 Come hell, high water, or the welfare line, Wendy was right. Pounding this
 machine to death would be the height of folly, no matter how pleasant an aspect
 that folly made. It would almost be tantamount to pounding his own son to death.
  "Fucking Luddite," he said aloud.
  He went to the back of the machine and unscrewed the gascap. He found a
 dipstick on one of the shelves that ran at chest-height around the walls and
 slipped it in. The last eighth of an inch came out wet. Not very much, but
 enough to see if the damn thing would run. Later he could siphon more from the
 Volks and the hotel truck.
  He screwed the cap back on and opened the cowling. No sparkplugs, no battery.
 He went to the shelf again and began to poke along it, pushing aside
 screwdrivers and adjustable wrenches, a one-lung carburetor that had been taken
 out of an old lawnmower, plastic boxes of screws and nails and bolts of varying
 sizes. The shelf was thick and dark with old grease, and the years
t like touching it.
  He found a small, oil-stained box with the abbreviation Skid. laconically
 marked on it in pencil. He shook it and something rattled inside. Plugs. He held
 one of them up to the light, trying to estimate the gap without hunting around
 for the gapping tool. Fuck it, he thought resentfully, and dropped the plug back
 into the box. If the gap
s just too damn bad. Tough fucking titty.
  There was a stool behind the door. He dragged it over, sat down, and installed
 the four sparkplugs, then fitted the small rubber caps over each. That done, be
 let his fingers play briefly over the magneto. They laughed when I sat down at
 the piano.
  Back to the shelves. This time he couldn
t bother him in the slightest. In fact, it
 made him feel glad. He was relieved. I did my best, Captain, but I could not get
 through. That

 fine snowmobile battery? Yes, that might come in handy. Toss it in the sack.
 White-collar crime, Baby. Everybody has sticky fingers. Under-the-jacket
 discount, we used to call it when we were kids.
  He walked back to the snowmobile and gave the side of it a good healthy kick
 as he went by. Well, that was the end of it. He would just have to tell Wendy
 sorry, baby, but-

  There was a box sitting in the corner by the door. The stool bad been right
 over it. Written on the top, in pencil, was the abbreviation Skid.
  He looked at it, the smile drying up on his lips. Look, sir, it
t fair.
  Goddammit, it just wasn
t over yet.
  Resentment, a gray, sullen wave of it, pushed up his throat. His hands had
 clenched into fists again.
  (Not fair, goddammit, not fair!)
  Why couldn
t he had a
 crick in his neck or an itch in his nose or the need to blink? Just one of those
 little things. He never would have seen it.

  He looked up at the banks of windows and the sun threw back an almost blinding
 glare from their many-paned surfaces but he looked anyway. For the first time he
 noticed how much they seemed like eyes. They reflected away the sun and held
 their own darkness within. It was not Danny they were looking at. It was him.

  In those few seconds he understood everything. There was a certain black-and
white picture he remembered seeing as a child, in catechism class. The nun had
 presented it to them on an easel and called it a miracle of God. The class had
 looked at it blankly, seeing nothing but a jumble of whites and blacks,
 senseless and patternless Then one of the children in the third row had gasped,
 "It
 and that child had gone home with a brand-new Testament and also a
 calendar because he had been first. The others stared even harder, Jacky
 Torrance among them. One by one the other kids had given a similar gasp, one
 little girl transported in near-ecstasy, crying out shrilly: 
 She had also been rewarded with a Testament. At last everyone had seen the
 face of Jesus in the jumble of blacks and whites except Jacky. He strained
 harder and harder, scared now, part of him cynically thinking that everyone else
 was simply putting on to please Sister Beatrice, part of him secretly convinced
 that he wasn't seeing it because God had decided he was the worst sinner in the
 class. 
t you see it, Jacky?" Sister Beatrice had asked him in her sad,
 sweet manner. I see your tits, he had thought in vicious desperation. He began
 to shake his head, then faked excitement and said: "Yes, I do! Wow! It is Jesus!
 " And everyone in class had laughed and applauded him, making him feel
 triumphant, ashamed, and scared. Later, when everyone else had tumbled their way
 up from the church basement and out onto the street he had lingered behind,
 looking at the meaningless black-and-white jumble that Sister Beatrice had left
 on the easel. He hated it. They had all made it up the way he had, even Sister
 herself. It was a big fake. "Shitfire-hellfire-shitfire," he had whispered under
 his breath, and as he turned to go he bad seen the face of Jesus from the corner
 of his eye, sad and. wise. He turned back, his heart in his throat. Everything
 had suddenly clicked into place and he had stared at the picture with fearful
 wonder, unable to believe he had missed it. The eyes, the zigzag of shadow
 across the care-worn brow, the fine nose, the compassionate lips. Looking at
 Jack Torrance. What had only been a meaningless sprawl had suddenly been
 transformed into a stark black-and-white etching of the face of ChristOur-Lord.
 Fearful wonder became terror. He had cussed in front of a picture of Jesus. He
 would be damned. He would be in hell with the sinners. The face of Christ had
 been in the picture all along. All along.
  Now, kneeling in the sun and watching his son playing in the shadow of the
 hotel, he knew that it was all true. The hotel wanted Danny, maybe all of them
 but Danny for sure. The hedges had really walked. There was a dead woman in 217,
 a woman that was perhaps only a spirit and harmless under most circumstances,
 but a woman who was now an active danger. Like some malevolent clockwork toy she
 had been wound up and set in motion by Danny
t matter. There had been an
 assassination on the third floor. How many old quarrels, suicides, strokes? How
 many murders? Was Grady lurking somewhere in the west wing with his ax, just

 waiting for Danny to start him up so he could come back out of the woodwork?
  The puffed circle of bruises around Danny

  He got up suddenly, thrusting the snowshoes back out the door. He was shaking
 all over. He slammed the door and picked up the box with the battery in it. It
 slipped through his shaking fingers
  (oh christ what if i cracked it)
  and thumped over on its side. He pulled the flaps of the carton open and
 yanked the battery out, heedless of the acid that might be leaking through the
 battery
t. It was whole. A little sigh
 escaped his lips.
  Cradling it, he took it over to the Skidoo and put it on its platform near the
 front of the engine. He found a small adjustable wrench on one of the shelves
 and attached the battery cables quickly and with no trouble. The battery was
 live; no need to use the charger on it. There had been a crackle of electricity
 and a small odor of ozone when he slipped the positive cable onto its terminal.
 The job done, he stood away, wiping his hands nervously on his faded denim
 jacket. There. It should work. No reason why not. No reason at all except that

 had no doubts. Going down would be the wrong decision, he had known that then.
 Wendy was only scared of the boogeyman summoned up by a single hysterical little
 boy. Now suddenly, he could see her side. It was like his play, his damnable
 play. He no longer knew which side he was on, or how things should come out.
 Once you saw the face of a god in those jumbled blacks and whites, it was
 everybody out of the pool-you could never unsee it. Others might laugh and say

  It had been all right until he had seen Danny playing in the snow. It was

 he said, very softly. That was it. It was like trying to play
 solitaire with one of the aces missing from the deck.
  Abruptly he leaned over the Skidoo's motor compartment and yanked off the
 magneto. It came off with sickening ease. He looked at it for a moment, then
 went to the equipment shed's back door and opened it.
  From here the view of the mountains was unobstructed, picture-postcard
 beautiful in the twinkling brightness of morning. An unbroken field of snow rose
 to the first pines about a mile distant. He flung the magneto as far out into
 the snow as he could. It went much further than it should have. There was a
 light puff of snow when it fell. The light breeze carried the snow granules away
 to fresh resting places. Disperse there, I say. There's nothing to see. It's all
 over. Disperse.
  He felt at peace.
  He stood in the doorway for a long time, breathing the good mountain air, and
 then he closed it firmly and went back out the other door to tell Wendy they
 would be staying. On the way, he stopped and had a snowball fight with Danny.

                                  THE HEDGES
  It was November 29, three days after Thanksgiving. The last week had been a
 good one, the Thanksgiving dinner the best they'd ever had as a family. Wendy
 had cooked Dick Hallorann's turkey to a turn and they had all eaten to bursting
 without even coming close to demolishing the jolly bird. Jack had groaned that
 they would be eating turkey for the rest of the winter--creamed turkey, turkey
 sandwiches, turkey and noodles, turkey surprise.
  No, Wendy told him with a little smile. Only until Christmas. Then we have the
 capon.
  Jack and Danny groaned together.
  The bruises on Danny's neck had faded, and their fears seemed to have faded
 with them. On Thanksgiving afternoon Wendy had been pulling Danny around on his
 sled while Jack worked on the play, which was now almost done.
  
 she had asked, not knowing bow to put the
 question less baldly.
  
 he answered simply. 

  
re
 not checking in on the CB radio. They

  
 he had answered noncommittally.
  On this sparkling afternoon the two of them were upstairs, and Danny knew that
 they had been making love. They were dozing now. They were happy, he knew. His
 mother was still a little bit afraid, but his father's attitude was strange. It
 was a feeling that he had done something that was very hard and had done it
 right. But Danny could not seem to see exactly what the something was. His
 father was guarding that carefully, even in his own mind. Was it possible, Danny
 wondered, to be glad you had done something and still be so ashamed of that
 something that you tried not to think of it? The question was a disturbing one.
 He didn't think such a thing was possible . . . in a normal mind. His hardest
 probings at his father had only brought him a dim picture of something like an
 octopus, whirling up into the hard blue sky. And on both occasions that he had
 concentrated hard enough to get this, Daddy had suddenly been staring at him in
 a sharp and frightening way, as if he knew what Danny was doing.
  Now he was in the lobby, getting ready to go out. He went out a lot, taking
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (216 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 his sled or wearing his snowshoes. He liked to get out of the hotel. When he was
 out in the sunshine, it seemed like a weight had slipped from his shoulders.
  He pulled a chair over, stood on it, and got his parka and snow pants out of
 the ballroom closet, and then sat down on the chair to put them on. His boots
 were in the boot box and he pulled them on, his tongue creeping out into the
 corner of his mouth in concentration as he laced them and tied the rawhide into
 careful granny knots. He pulled on his mittens and his ski mask and was ready.
  He tramped out through the kitchen to the back door, then paused. He was tired
 of playing out back, and at this time of day the hotel's shadow would be cast
 over his play area. He didn't even like being in the Overlook's shadow. He
 decided be would put on his snowshoes and go down to the playground instead.
 Dick Hallorann had told him to stay away from the topiary, but the thought of
 the hedge animals did not bother him much. They were buried under snowdrifts
 now, nothing showing but a vague hump that was the rabbit's head and the lions'
 tails. Sticking out of the snow the way they were, the tails looked more absurd
 than frightening.
  Danny opened the back door and got his snowshoes from the milk platform. Five
 minutes later he was strapping them to his feet on the front porch. His daddy
 had told him that he (Danny) had the hang of using the snowshoes-the lazy,
 shuffling stride, the twist of ankle that shook the powdery snow from the
 lacings just before the boot came back down-and all that remained was for him to
 build up the necessary muscles in his thighs and calves and ankles. Danny found
 it at his ankles got tired the fastest. Snowshoeing was almost as hard on your
 ankles as skating, because you had to keep clearing the lacings. Every five
 minutes or so he had to stop with his legs spread and the snowshoes fat on the
 snow to rest them.
  But he didn't have to rest on his way down to the playground because it was
 all downhill. Less than ten minutes after he struggled up and over the monstrous
 snow-dune that had drifted in on the Overlook's front porch he was standing with
 his mittened hand on the playground slide. He wasn't even breathing hard.
  The playground seemed much nicer in the deep snow than it ever had during the
 autumn. It looked like a fairyland sculpture. The swing chains had been frozen
 in strange positions, the seats of the big kids' swings resting flush against
 the snow. The jungle gym was an ice-cave guarded by dripping icicle teeth. Only
 the chimneys of the play-Overlook stuck up over the snow
  (wish the other one was buried that way only not with us in it)
  and the tops of the cement rings protruded in two places like Eskimo igloos.
 Danny tramped over there, squatted, and began to dig. Before long he had
 uncovered the dark mouth of one of them and he slipped into the cold tunnel. In
 his mind he was Patrick McGoohan, the Secret Agent Man (they had shown the
 reruns of that program twice on the Burlington TV channel and his daddy never
 missed them; he would skip a party to stay home and watch 
 or 
 and Danny had always watched with him), on the run from KGB agents in
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (217 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 the mountains of Switzerland. There had been avalanches in the area and the
 notorious KGB agent Slobbo had killed his girlfriend with a poison dart, but
 somewhere near was the Russian antigravity machine. Perhaps at the end of this
 very tunnel. He drew his automatic and went along the concrete tunnel, his eyes
 wide and alert, his breath pluming out.
  The far end of the concrete ring was solidly blocked with snow. He tried
 digging through it and was amazed (and a little uneasy) to see how solid it was,
 almost like ice from the cold and the constant weight of more snow on top of it.
  His make-believe game collapsed around him and he was suddenly aware that he
 felt closed in and extremely nervous in this tight ring of cement. He could hear
 his breathing; it sounded dank and quick and hollow. He was under the snow, and
 hardly any light filtered down the hole he had dug to get in here. Suddenly he
 wanted to be out in the sunlight more than anything, suddenly he remembered his
 daddy and mommy were sleeping and didn't know there he was, that if the hole he
 dug caved in he would be trapped, and the Overlook didn't like him.
  Danny got turned around with some difficulty and crawled back along the length
 of the concrete ring, his snowshoes clacking woodenly together behind him, his
 palms crackling in last fall's dead aspen leaves beneath him. He had just
 reached the end and the cold spill of light coming down from above when the snow
 did give in, a minor fall, but enough to powder his face and clog the opening he
 had wriggled down through and leave him in darkness.
  For a moment his brain froze in utter panic and he could not think. Then, as
 if from far off, he heard his daddy telling him that he must never play at the
 Stovington dump, because sometimes stupid people hauled old refrigerators off to
 the dump without removing the doors and if you got in one and the door happened
 to shut on you, there was no way to get out. You would die in the darkness.
  (You wouldn't want a thing like that to happen to you, would you, doc?)
  (No, Daddy.)
  But it had happened, his frenzied mind told him, it had happened, he was in
 the dark, he was closed in, and it was as cold as a refrigerator. And-
  (something is in here with me.)
  His breath stopped in a gasp. An almost drowsy terror stole through his veins.
 Yes. Yes. There was something in here with him, some awful thing the Overlook
 had saved for just such a chance as this. Maybe a huge spider that had burrowed
 down under the dead leaves, or a rat . . . or maybe the corpse of some little
 kid that had died here on the playground. Had that ever happened? Yes, he
 thought maybe it had. He thought of the woman in the tub. The blood and brains
 on the wall of the Presidential Sweet. Of some little kid, its head split open
 from a fall from the monkey bars or a swing, crawling after him in the dark,
 grinning, looking for one final playmate in its endless playground. Forever. In
 a moment he would hear it coming.
  At the far end of the concrete ring, Danny heard the stealthy crackle of dead
 leaves as something came for him on its hands and knees. At any moment he would
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (218 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 feel its cold hand close over his ankle-
  That thought broke his paralysis. He was digging at the loose fall of snow
 that choked the end of the concrete ring, throwing it back between his legs in
 powdery bursts like a dog digging for a bone. Blue light filtered down from
 above and Danny thrust himself up at it like a diver coming out of deep water.
 He scraped his back on the lip of the concrete ring. One of his snowshoes
 twisted behind the other. Snow spilled down inside his ski mask and into the
 collar of his parka. He dug at the snow, clawed at it. It seemed to be trying to
 hold him, to suck him back down, back into the concrete ring where that unseen,
 leaf-crackling thing was, and keep him there. Forever.
  Then he was out, his face was turned up to the sun, and he was crawling
 through the snow, crawling away from the half-buried cement ring, gasping
 harshly, his face almost comically white with powdered snow--a living fright
mask. He hobbled over to the jungle gym and sat down to readjust his snowshoes
 and get his breath. As he set them to rights and tightened the straps again, he
 never took his eyes from the hole at the end of the concrete ring. He waited to
 see if something would come out. Nothing did, and after three or four minutes,
 Danny's breathing began to slow down. Whatever it was, it couldn't stand the
 sunlight. It was cooped up down there, maybe only able to come out when it was
 dark. . . or when both ends of its circular prison were plugged with snow.
  (but i'm safe now i'm safe i'll just go back because now i'm )
  Something thumped softly behind him.
  He turned around, toward the hotel, and looked. But even before he looked
  (Can you see the Indians in this picture?)
  he knew what he would see, because he knew what that soft thumping sound had
 been. It was the sound of a large clump of snow falling, the way it sounded when
 it slid off the roof of the hotel and fell to the ground.
  (Can you see--?)
  Yes. He could. The snow had fallen off the hedge dog. When he came down it had
 only been a harmless lump of snow outside the playground. Now it stood revealed,
 an incongruous splash of green in all the eye-watering whiteness. It was sitting
 up, as if to beg a sweet or a scrap.
  But this time he wouldn't go crazy, he wouldn't blow his cool. Because at
 least he wasn't trapped in some dark old hole. He was in the sunlight. And it
 was just a dog. It's pretty warm out today, he thought hopefully. Maybe the sun
 just melted enough snow off that old dog so the rest fell off in a bunch. Maybe
 that's all it is.
  (Don't go near that place . . . steer right clear.)
  His snowshoe bindings were as tight as they were ever going to be. He stood up
 and stared back at the concrete ring, almost completely submerged in the snow,
 and what he saw at the end he had exited from froze his heart. There was a
 circular patch of darkness at the end of it, a fold of shadow that marked the
 hole he'd dug to get down inside. Now, in spite of the snow-dazzle, he thought
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (219 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 he could see something there. Something moving. A hand. The waving hand of some
 desperately unhappy child, waving hand, pleading band, drowning hand.
  (Save me O please save me If you can't save me at least come play with me . .
 . Forever. And Forever. And Forever.)
  
 Danny whispered huskily. The word fell dry and bare from his mouth,
 which was stripped of moisture. He could feel his mind wavering now, trying to
 go away the way it had when the woman in the room had . . . no, better not think
 of that.
  He grasped at the strings of reality and held them tightly. He had to get out
 of here. Concentrate on that. Be cool. Be like the Secret Agent Man. Would
 Patrick McGoohan be crying and peeing in his pants like a little baby?
  Would his daddy?
  That calmed him somewhat.
  From behind him, that soft Hump sound of falling snow came again. He turned
 around and the head of one of the hedge lions was sticking out of the snow now,
 snarling at him. It was closer than it should have been, almost up to the gate
 of the playground.
  Terror tried to rise up and he quelled it. He was the Secret Agent Man, and he
 would escape.
  He began to walk out of the playground, taking the same roundabout course his
 father had taken on the day that the snow flew. He concentrated on operating the
 snowshoes. Slow, flat strides. Don't lift your foot too high or you'll lose your
 balance. Twist your ankle and spill the snow off the crisscrossed lacings. It
 seemed so slow. He reached the corner of the playground. The snow was drifted
 high here and he was able to step over the fence. He got halfway over and then
 almost fell flat when the snowshoe on his behind foot caught on one of the fence
 posts. He leaned on the outside edge of gravity, pinwheeling his arms,
 remembering how bard it was to get up once you fell down.
  From his right, that soft sound again, falling clumps of snow. He looked over
 and saw the other two lions, clear of snow now down to their forepaws, side by
 side, about sixty paces away. The green indentations that were their eyes were
 fixed on him. The dog had turned its head.
  (It only happens when you're not looking.)
  

  His snowshoes had crossed and he plunged forward into the snow, arms waving
 uselessly. More snow got inside his hood and down his neck and into the tops of
 his boots. He struggled out of the snow and tried to get the snowshoes under
 him, heart hammering crazily now
  (Secret Agent Man remember you're the Secret Agent)
  and overbalanced backward. For a moment he lay there looking at the sky,
 thinking it would be simpler to just give up.
  Then he thought of the thing in the concrete tunnel and knew he could not. He
 gained his feet and stared over at the topiary. All three lions were bunched

 together now, not forty feet away. The dog had ranged off to their left, as if
 to block Danny's retreat. They were bare of snow except for powdery ruffs around
 their necks and muzzles. They were all staring at him.
  His breath was racing now, and the panic was like a rat behind his forehead,
 twisting and gnawing. He fought the panic and he fought the snowshoes.
  (Daddy's voice: No, don't fight them, doc. Walk on them like they were your
 own feet. Walk with them.)
  (Yes, Daddy.)
  He began to walk again, trying to regain the easy rhythm he had practiced with
 his daddy. Little by little it began to come, but with the rhythm came an
 awareness of just how tired he was, how much his fear had exhausted him. The
 tendons of his thighs and calves and ankles were hot and trembly. Ahead he could
 see the Overlook, mockingly distant, seeming to stare at him with its many
 windows, as if this were some sort of contest in which it was mildly interested.
  Danny looked back over his shoulder and his hurried breathing caught for a
 moment and then hurried on even faster. The nearest lion was now only twenty
 feet behind, breasting through the snow like a dog paddling in a pond. The two
 others were to its right and left, pacing it. They were like an army platoon on
 patrol, the dog, still off to their left, the scout. The closest lion had its
 head down. The shoulders bunched powerfully above its neck. The tail was up, as
 if in the instant before he had turned to look it had been swishing back and
 forth, back and forth. He thought it looked like a great big housecat that was
 having a good time playing with a mouse before killing it.
  (--falling--)
  No, if he fell he was dead. They would never let him get up. They would
 pounce. He pinwheeled his arms madly and lunged ahead, his center of gravity
 dancing just beyond his nose. He caught it and hurried on, snapping glances back
 over his shoulder. The air whistled in and out of his dry throat like hot glass.
  The world closed down to the dazzling snow, the green hedges, and the whispery
 sound of his snowshoes. And something else. A soft, muffled padding sound. He
 tried to hurry faster and couldn't. He was walking over the buried driveway now,
 a small boy with his face almost buried in the shadow of his parka hood. The
 afternoon was still and bright.
  When he looked back again, the point lion was only five feet behind. It was
 grinning. Its mouth was open, its haunches tensed down like a clockspring.
 Behind it and the others he could see the rabbit, its head now sticking out of
 the snow, bright green, as if it had turned its horrid blank face to watch the
 end of the stalk.
  Now, on the Overlook's front lawn between the circular drive and the porch, he
 let the panic loose and began to run clumsily in the snowshoes, not daring to
 look back now, tilting further and further forward, his arms out ahead of him
 like a blind man feeling for obstacles. His hood fell back, revealing his
 complexion, paste white giving way to hectic red blotches on his cheeks, his
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (221 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 eyes bulging with terror. The porch was very close now.
  Behind him he heard the sudden hard crunch of snow as something leaped.
  He fell on the porch steps, screaming without sound, and scrambled up them on
 his hands and knees, snowshoes clattering and askew behind him.
  There was a slashing sound in the air and sudden pain in his leg. The ripping
 sound of cloth. Something else that might have--must have--been in his mind.
  Bellowing, angry roar.
  Smell of blood and evergreen.
  He fell full-length on the porch, sobbing hoarsely, the rich, metallic taste
 of copper in his mouth. His heart was thundering in his chest. There was a small
 trickle of blood coming from his nose.
  He had no idea how long he lay there before the lobby doors flew open and Jack
 ran out, wearing just his jeans and a pair of slippers. Wendy was behind him.
  
 she screamed.
  
s sake! What

  Daddy was helping him up. Below the knee his snowpants were ripped open.
 Inside, his woollen ski sock had been ripped open and his calf had been
 shallowly scratched . . . as if he had tried to push his way through a closely
 grown evergreen hedge and the branches had clawed him.
  He looked over his shoulder. Far down the lawn, past the putting green, were a
 number of vague, snow-cowled humps. The hedge animals. Between them and the
 playground. Between them and the road.
  His legs gave way. Jack caught him. He began to cry.
                                   << 35 >>
                                   THE LOBBY
  He had told them everything except what had happened to him when the snow had
 blocked the end of the concrete ring. He couldn't bring himself to repeat that.
 And be didn't know the right words to express the creeping, lassitudinous sense
 of terror he had felt when he heard the dead aspen leaves begin to crackle
 furtively down there in the cold darkness. But he told them about the soft sound
 of snow falling in clumps. About the lion with its head and its bunched
 shoulders working its way up and out of the snow to chase him. He even told them
 about how the rabbit had turned its head to watch near the end.
  The three of them were in the lobby. Jack had built a roaring blaze in the
 fireplace. Danny was bundled up in a blanket on the small sofa where once, a

 million years ago, three nuns had sat laughing like girls while they waited for
 the line at the desk to thin out. He was sipping hot noodle soup from a mug.
 Wendy sat beside him, stroking his hair. Jack had sat on the floor, his face
 seeming to grow more and more still, more and more set as Danny told his story.
 Twice he pulled his handkerchief out of his back pocket and rubbed his
 sorelooking lips with it.
  
 he finished. Jack got up and went over to the window,
 his back to them. He looked at his mommy. 
 He was struggling to keep his voice calm, because if he stayed calm
 maybe they would believe him. Mr. Stenger hadn't stayed calm. He had started to
 cry and hadn't been able to stop SO THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS had come to take
 him away because if you couldn't stop crying it meant you had LOST YOUR MARBLES
 and when would you be back? NO ONE KNOWS. His parka and snowpants and the
 clotted snowshoes lay on the rug just inside the big double doors.
  (I won't cry I won't let myself cry)
  And he thought he could do that, but he couldn't stop shaking. He looked into
 the fire and waited for Daddy to say something. High yellow flames danced on the
 dark stone hearth. A pine-knot exploded with a bang and sparks rushed up the
 flue.
  
 Jack turned around. His face still had that pinched,
 deathly look. Danny didn't like to look at it.
  

  

  Danny slipped off the sofa and came over beside his daddy.
  

  Danny bad known what he would see even before he got to the window. Below the
 clutter of boot tracks, sled tracks, and snowshoe tracks that marked their usual
 exercise area, the snowfield that covered the Overlook's lawns sloped down to
 the topiary and the playground beyond. It was marred by two sets of tracks, one
 of them in a straight line from the porch to the playground, the other a long,
 looping line coming back up.
  

  

  Danny's lips began to tremble. He was going to cry. What if he couldn't stop?
  (i won't cry I Won't Cry Won't Won't WON'T)
  
 he whispered.

  He looked at her furiously, and then the fury collapsed. Suddenly, with pity
 and horror, she saw what Jack would look like as an old man. She had never seen
 him look that way before.
  (?what way?)
  Defeated, she answered herself. He looks beaten.
  He said: "I always thought I could keep my promises."
  She went to him and put her hands on his arm. "All right, it

  "All right," Jack said, and at that moment, at least, he meant it. The same
 way he had always meant it on those mornings after, looking at his pale and
 haggard face in the bathroom mirror. I

t bothered with the lights. She fumbled for the switch that lit the
 four spaced overheads in the hallway that led to the main corridor. Up ahead,
 Jack was already turning the corner. This time Danny found the switchplate and
 flicked all three switches up. The hallway leading down to the stairs and the
 elevator shaft came alight.
  Jack was standing at the elevator station, which was flanked by benches and
 cigarette urns. He was standing motionless in front of the closed elevator door.
 In his faded tartan bathrobe and brown leather slippers with the rundown heels,
 his hair all in sleep corkscrews and Alfalfa cowlicks, he looked to her like an

 was all eyes. His mouth was pressed into a frightened, bloodless slit. Above
 them, the brass gate rattled back. The elevator door thumped open, it thumped

 He looked at her with deadly blandness.
  She turned to Danny. 

  Danny nodded slowly. 

  The elevator car stopped again. The hotel was silent, creaking, deserted.
 Outside, the wind whined around the eaves in the darkness.
  
 Jack said conversationally. 
t hear a
 goddamned thing except that elevator having a case of the electrical hiccups. If
 you two want to have duet hysterics, fine. But count me out."
  The elevator was coming down again.
  Jack stepped to the right, where a glass-fronted box was mounted on the wall
 at chest height. He smashed his bare fist against it. Glass tinkled inward.
 Blood dripped from two of his knuckles. He reached in and took out a key with a
 long, smooth barrel.
  "Jack, no. Don

  

  She tried to grab his arm. He pushed her backward. Her feet tangled in the hem
 of her robe and she fell to the carpet with an ungainly thump. Danny cried out
 shrilly and fell on his knees beside her. Jack turned back to the elevator and
 thrust the key into the socket.
  The elevator cables disappeared and the bottom of the car came into view in
 the small window. A second later Jack turned the key hard. There was a grating,
 screeching sound as the elevator car came to an instant standstill. For a moment
 the declutched motor in the basement whined even louder, and then its circuit
 breaker cut in and the Overlook went unearthly still. The night wind outside
 seemed very loud by comparison. Jack looked stupidly at the gray metal elevator
 door. There were three splotches of blood below the keyhole from his lacerated
 knuckles.
  He turned back to Wendy and Danny for a moment. She was sitting up, and Danny
 had his arm around her. They were both staring at him carefully, as if he was a
 stranger they had never seen before, possibly a dangerous one. He opened his
 mouth, not sure what was going to come out.

  She said clearly: "Fuck your job"
  He turned back to the elevator, worked his fingers into the crack that ran
 down the right side of the door, and got it to open a little way. Then he was
 able to get his whole weight on it and threw the door open.
  The car had stopped halfway, its floor at Jack

s bottom edge and
 pulled herself up enough so she could look in. Then, with a convulsive heave of
 her shoulder and belly muscles, she tried to boost herself all the way up. For a
 moment the issue was in doubt. Her feet tottered over the blackness of the shaft
 and one pink slipper fell from her foot and slipped out of sight.
  "Mommy!" Danny screamed.
  Then she was up, her cheeks flushed, her forehead as pale and shining as a
 spirit lamp. "What about this, Jack? Is this a short circuit?" She threw
 something and suddenly the hall was full of drifting confetti, red and white and
 blue and yellow. "Is this?" A green party streamer, faded to a pale pastel color
 with age.
  "And this?"
  She tossed it out and it came to rest on the blue-black jungle carpet, a black
 silk cat
Does that look like a short circuit to you, Jack?

strewn hallway carpet.

                                 THE BALLROOM
  It was the first of December.
  Danny was in the east-wing ballroom, standing on an over-stuffed, high-backed
 wing chair, looking at the clock under glass. It stood in the center of the
 ballroom

  he cried to some half-felt presence in the room.
  (Doesn
m just five?)
  There was no answer.
  He turned reluctantly back to the clock.
  He had been putting it off, hoping that something would happen to help him
 avoid trying to call Tony again, that a ranger would come, or a helicopter, or
 the rescue team; they always came in time on his TV programs, the people were
 saved. On TV the rangers and the SWAT squad and the paramedics were a friendly
 white force counterbalancing the confused evil that he perceived in the world;
 when people got in trouble they were helped out of it, they were fixed up. They
 did not have to help themselves out of trouble.
  (Please?)
  There was no answer.
  No answer, and if Tony came would it be the same nightmare? The booming, the
 Tioarse and petulant voice, the blueblack rug like snakes? Redrum?
  But what else?
  (Please oh please)
  No answer.
  With a trembling sigh, he looked at the clockface. Cogs turned and meshed with
 other cogs. The balance wheel rocked hypnotically back and forth. And if you
 held your head perfectly still, you could see the minute hand creeping
 inexorably down from XII to V. If you held your bead perfectly still you could
 see that-
  The clockface was gone. In its place was a round black hole. It led down into
 forever. It began to swell. The clock was gone. The room behind it. Danny
 tottered and then fell into the darkness that had been biding behind the
 clockface all along.
  The small boy in the chair suddenly collapsed and lay in it at a crooked
 unnatural angle, his head thrown back, his eyes staring sightlessly at the high
 ballroom ceiling.
  Down and down and down and down to-
  --the hallway, crouched in the hallway, and he had made a wrong turn, trying
 to get back to the stairs he had made a wrong turn and now AND NOW-
  --he saw he was in the short dead-end corridor that led only to the
 Presidential Suite and the booming sound was coming closer, the roque mallet
 whistling savagely through the air, the head of it embedding itself into the
 wall, cutting the silk paper, letting out small puffs of plaster dust.
  (Goddammit, come out here! Take your)
  But there was another figure in the hallway. Slouched nonchalantly against the
 wall just behind him. Like a ghost.
  No, not a ghost, but all dressed in white. Dressed in whites.

  But as he watched, Dick Hallorann turned, put his cigarette back into the
 corner of his mouth, and stepped nonchalantly through the wall.
  Leaving him alone.

s record player overturned on the floor. Her records scattered on
 the rug. The mattress half off the bed. Pictures ripped from the walls. His cot
 lying on its side like a dead dog, the Violent Violet Volkswagen crushed to
 purple shards of plastic.
  The light was coming from the bathroom door, half-open. Just beyond it a hand
 dangled limply, blood dripping from the tips of the fingers. And in the medicine
 cabinet mirror, the word REDRUM flashing off and on.
  Suddenly a huge clock in a glass bowl materialized in front of it. There were
 no hands or numbers on the clockface, only a date written in red: DECEMBER 2.
 And then, eyes widening in horror, he saw the word REDRUM reflecting dimly from
 the glass dome, now reflected twice. And he saw that it spelled MURDER.

 swelled and swelled like a dilating iris. It blotted out everything and he fell
 forward, beginning to fall, falling, he was-

  (The Red Death held sway over all!)
  (Unmask! Unmask!)
  And behind each glittering lovely mask, the as-yet unseen face of the shape
 that chased him down these dark hallways, its red eyes widening, blank and
 homicidal.
  Oh, he was afraid of what face might come to light when the time for unmasking
 came around at last.
                                    (DICK!)
  he screamed with all his might. His   head seemed to shiver with the force of
 it.
  (!!! OH DICK OH PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COME !!!)
  Above him the clock he had wound with the silver key continued to mark off the
 seconds and minutes and hours.

  Mrs. Hallorann
s whites, a Lucky Strike
 parked in the corner of his mouth, backed his reclaimed Cadillac limo out of its
 space behind the One-A Wholesale Vegetable Mart and drove slowly around the
 building. Masterton, part owner now but still walking with the patented shuffle
 he had adopted back before World War II, was pushing a bin of lettuces into the
 high, dark building.
  Hallorann pushed the button that lowered the passenger side window and
 hollered: "Those avocadoes is too damn high, you cheapskate!"
  Masterton looked back over his shoulder, grinned widely enough to expose all
 three gold teeth, and yelled back, "And I know exactly where you can put em, my
 good buddy."
  "Remarks like that I keep track of, bro."
  Masterton gave him the finger. Hallorann returned the compliment.
  "Get your cukes, did you?" Masterton asked.
  "I did."
  "You come back early tomorrow, I gonna give you some of the nicest new
 potatoes you ever seen."
  "I send the boy," Hallorann said. "You comin up tonight?"
  "You supplyin the juice, bro?"
  "That

  "Listen to this sassy nigger. Would you listen?"
  "Go on, get outta here fore I start throwin these lettuces."
  "Go on an throw em. I

  Masterton made as if to throw one. Hallorann ducked, rolled up the window, and
 drove on. He was feeling fine. For the last half hour or so he had been smelling
 oranges, but he didn't find that queer. For the last half hour he had been in a
 fruit and vegetable market.
  It was 4:30 p.m., EST, the first day of December, Old Man Winter settling his

 frostbitten rump firmly onto most of the country, but down here the men wore
 open-throated shortsleeve shirts and the women were in light summer dresses and
 shorts. On top of the First Bank of Florida building, a digital thermometer
 bordered with huge grapefruits was flashing 79° over and over. Thank God for
 Florida, Hallorann thought, mosquitoes and all.
  In the back of the limo were two dozen avocados, a crate of cucumbers, ditto
 oranges, ditto grapefruit. Three shopping sacks filled with Bermuda onions, the
 sweetest vegetable a loving God ever created, some pretty good sweet peas, which
 would be served with the entree and come back uneaten nine times out of ten, and
 a single blue Hubbard squash that was strictly for personal consumption.
  Hallorann stopped in the turn lane at the Vermont Street light, and when the
 green arrow showed he pulled out onto state highway 219, pushing up to forty and
 holding it there until the town began to trickle away into an exurban sprawl of
 gas stations, Burger Kings, and McDonalds. It was a small order today, he could
 have sent Baedecker after it, but Baedecker had been chafing for his chance to
 buy the meat, and besides, Hallorann never missed a chance to bang it back and
 forth with Frank Masterton if he could help it. Masterton might show up tonight
 to watch some TV and drink Hallorann's Bushmill's, or he might not. Either way
 was all right. But seeing him mattered. Every time it mattered now, because they
 weren't young anymore. In the last few days it seemed he was thinking of that
 very fact a great deal. Not so young anymore, when you got up near sixty years
 old (ortell the truth and save a lie-past it) you had to start thinking about
 stepping out. You could go anytime. And that had been on his mind this week, not
 in a heavy way but as a fact. Dying was a part of living. You had to keep tuning
 in to that if you expected to be a whole person. And if the fact of your own
 death was hard to understand, at least it wasn't impossible to accept.
  Why this should have been on his mind he could not have said, but his other
 reason for getting this small order himself was so he could step upstairs to the
 small office over Frank's Bar and Grill. There was a lawyer up there now (the
 dentist who had been there last year had apparently gone broke), a young black
 fellow named McIver. Hallorann had stepped in and told this McIver that he
 wanted to make a will, and could McIver help him out? Well, McIver asked, how
 soon do you want the document? Yesterday, said Hallorann, and threw his head
 back and laughed. Have you got anything complicated in mind? was McIver's next
 question. Hallorann did not. He had his Cadillac, his bank account--some nine
 thousand dollars--a piddling checking account, and a closet of clothes. He
 wanted it all to go to his sister. And if your sister predeceases you? McIver
 asked. Never mind, Hallorann said. If that happens, I'll make a new will. The
 document had been completed and signed in less than three hours--fast work for a
 shyster--and now resided in Hallorann's breast pocket, folded into a stiff blue
 envelope with the word WILL on the outside in Old English letters.
  He could not have said why he had chosen this warm sunny day when he felt so
 well to do something he had been putting off for years, but the impulse had come

 on him and he hadn't said no. He was used to following his hunches.
  He was pretty well out of town now. He cranked the limo up to an illegal sixty
 and let it ride there in the left-hand lane, sucking up most of the Petersburg
bound traffic. He knew from experience that the limo would still ride as solid
 as iron at ninety, and even at a hundred and twenty it didn't seem to lighten up
 much. But his screamin days were long gone. The thought of putting the limo up
 to a hundred and twenty on a straight stretch only scared him. He was getting
 old.
  (Jesus, those oranges smell strong. Wonder if they gone over?)
  Bugs splattered against the window. He dialed the radio to a Miami soul
 station and got the soft, wailing voice of Al Green.
    
s getting late and we must leave each other. . ."
  He unrolled the window, pitched his cigarette butt out, then rolled it further
 down to clear out the smell of the oranges. He tapped his fingers against the
 wheel and hummed along under his breath. Hooked over the rearview mirror, his
 St. Christopher
s clothes. The workman saw the limo drifting into his lane and laid on
 the born. When the Cadillac continued to drift he snapped a look at the driver
 and saw a big black man bolt upright behind the wheel, his eyes looking vaguely
 upward. Later the workman told his wife that he knew it was just one of those
 niggery hairdos they were all wearing these days, but at the time it had looked
 just as if every hair on that coon
s soul would occupy in the afterlife. He finished by saying that he
 believed be had met the limo-driver
s mind the thought kept repeating
  (COME DICK PLEASE COME DICK PLEASE)
  but it began to fade off the way a radio station will as you approach the
 limits of its broadcasting area. He became fuzzily aware that his car was
 tooling along the soft shoulder at better than fifty miles an hour. He guided it
 back onto the road, feeling the rear end fishtail for a moment before regaining
 the composition surface.
  There was an A/W Rootbeer stand just ahead. Hallorann signaled and turned in,
 his heart thudding painfully in his chest, his face a sickly gray color. He
 pulled into a parking slot, took his handkerchief out of his pocket, and mopped
 his forehead with it.
  (Lord God!)
  "May I help you?"
  The voice startled him again, even though it wasn
Yeah, baby, a rootbeer float. Two scoops of vanilla, okay?

  The manager was a man named Queems, and when Hallorann came in Queems was
 conversing with his bookie. He wanted the four-horse at Rockaway. No, no parlay,
 no quinella, no exacta, no goddam futura. Just the little old four, six hundred
 dollars on the nose. And the Jets on Sunday. What did he mean, the Jets were

  "Problems, Dick?"
  "Yes, sir, Mr. Queems, I guess so. I need three days off."
  There was a package of Kents in the breast pocket of Queems

s bloodshot eyes. He put it back in
 his pocket and, allowing his voice to drop another notch, said: "Jana sent it.
 It was waitin in my letterbox when I got back just now."
  "Jesus. Jesus Christ," Queems said. There was a peculiar tight expression of
 concern on his face, one Hallorann was familiar with. It was as close to an
 expression of sympathy as a white man who thought of himself as "good with the

  "Yeah, okay, you get going," Queems said. "Baedecker can take over for three
 days, I guess. The potboy can help out."
  Hallorann nodded, letting his face get longer still, but the thought of the
 potboy helping out Baedecker made him grin inside. Even on a good day Hallorann
 doubted if the potboy could hit the urinal on the first squirt.
  "I want to rebate back this week

  Queems's expression got tighter still it looked as if he might have a fishbone
 caught in his throat.

 Queems stood up, leaned sincerely forward, and inhaled a raft of
 ascending smoke from his Kent. He coughed heartily, his thin white face turning
 red. Hallorann struggled hard to keep his somber expression.

  They shook hands over the desk.

 had been on his mind like a . . . well, like a

  like a premonition,.
  Death? For a moment his whole life seemed to flash before him, not in a
 historical sense, no topography of the ups and downs that Mrs. Hallorann
s grave that he
 had been to the mountain. Dick could not claim that. No mountain, but he had
 reached a sunny plateau after years of struggle. He had good friends. He had all
 the references he would ever need to get a job anywhere. When he wanted fuck,
 why, he could find a friendly one with no questions asked and no big shitty
 struggle about what it all meant. He had come to terms with his blackness-happy
 terms. He was up past sixty and thank God, he was cruising.
  Was he going to chance the end of that--the end of him--for three white people
 he didn

  He knew the boy. They had shared each other the way good friends can

 something that had just been given.
  (Naw, you got a flashlight, he the one with the searchlight.)
  And sometimes that light, that shine, seemed like a pretty nice thing. You
 could pick the horses, or like the boy had said, you could tell your daddy where
 his trunk was when it turned up missing. But that was only dressing, the sauce
 on the salad, and down below there was as much bitter vetch in that salad as
 there was cool cucumber. You could taste pain and death and tears. And now the
 boy was stuck in that place, and he would go. For the boy. Because, speaking to
 the boy, they had only been different colors when they used their mouths. So he
 would go. He would do what he could, because if he didn

  Hallorann hadn
d been a goof-off and a sloven and the other girls had resented
 her, but Delores had had that little twinkle. It had always greased the skids
 for her. But what she had seen in 217 had scared her badly enough so she was
 more than glad to pick up the walking papers Ullman had issued her and go.
  Why had she come to him? A shine knows a shine, Hallorann thought, grinning at
 the pun.
  So he had gone up that night and bad let himself into the room, which was to
 be reoccupied the next day. He had used the office passkey to get in, and if
 Ullman had caught him with that key, he would have joined Delores Vickery on the
 unemployment line.
  The shower curtain around the tub had been drawn. He had pushed it back, but

 were those of rotting insects--and there had been the hedge animals. Twice,
 maybe three times, he had (or thought he had) seen them move, ever so slightly.
 That dog would seem to change from his sitting-up posture to a slightly crouched
 one, and the lions seemed to move forward, as if menacing the little tykes on
 the playground. Last year in May Ullman had sent him up to the attic to look for
 the ornate set of firetools that now stood beside the lobby fireplace. While he
 had been up there the three lightbulbs strung overhead had gone out and he had
 lost his way back to the trapdoor. He had stumbled around for an unknown length
 of time, closer and closer to panic, barking his shins on boxes and bumping into
 things, with a stronger and stronger feeling that something was stalking him in
 the dark. Some great and frightening creature that had just oozed out of the
 woodwork when the lights went out. And when he had literally stumbled over the
 trapdoor

 handsome movie actor, was a medically controlled epileptic who had simply
 forgotten her medicine that day.
  And so, staring down at the corpse of Mrs. Massey, he had been frightened but
 not completely terrified. It was not completely unexpected. Terror came when she
 opened her eyes to disclose blank silver pupils and began to grin at him. Horror
 came when
  (she had started to get out and come after him.)
  He had fled, heart racing, and had not felt safe even with the door shut and
 locked behind him. In fact, he admitted to himself now as he zipped the
 fiightbag shut, he had never felt safe anywhere in the Overlook again.
  And now the boy--calling, screaming for help.

  There was one due out at 6:36 P.m. Could the gentleman make that?

 up the stairs between the lobby and the first floor, tossing a red rubber ball
 from hand to band and singing one of the songs from that album. His voice was

 didn't wince, or even try to shake her off.

And the . . . the things

You can see--
I don't want to see,
But I can hear them sometimes, late at night. They're
 like the wind, all sighing together. In the attic. The basement. The rooms. All
 over. I thought it was my fault, because of the way I am. The key. The little
 silver key.
Danny, don't . . . don't upset yourself this way.
But it's him too,
It's Daddy. And it's you. It wants all of us.
 It's tricking Daddy, it's fooling him, trying to make him think it wants him the
 most. It wants me the most, but it will take all of us.

 He said if I ever needed him to just call. And I have been. But it's awful hard.
 It makes me tired. And the worst part is I don't know if he's hearing me or not.
 I don't think he can call back because it's too far for him. And I don't know if
 it's too far for me or not. Tomorrow-
What about tomorrow?
Nothing.

 it might have been a part of his own thoughts. It was soft and infinitely sly.
 Mocking him. Seeming to say:
  (Oh yes, you'll like it here. Try it, you'll like it. Try it, you'll liiiiike
 it--)
  Now his ears were open and he could hear them again, the gathering, ghosts or
 spirits or maybe the hotel itself, a dreadful funhouse where all the sideshows
 ended in death, where all the specially painted boogies were really alive, where
 hedges walked, where a small silver key could start the obscenity. Soft and
 sighing, rustling like the endless winter wind that played under the eaves at
 night, the deadly lulling wind the summer tourists never heard. It was like the
 somnolent hum of summer wasps in a ground nest, sleepy, deadly, beginning to
 wake up. They were ten thousand feet high.
  (Why is a raven like a writing desk? The higher the fewer, of course! Have
 another cup of tea!)
  It was a living sound, but not voices, not breath. A man of a philosophical
 bent might have called it the sound of souls. Dick Hallorann's Nana, who had
 grown up on southern roads in the years before the turn of the century, would
 have called it ha'ants. A psychic investigator might have had a long name for
 it--psychic echo, psychokinesis, a telesmic sport. But to Danny it was only the
 sound of the hotel, the old monster, creaking steadily and ever more closely
 around them: halls that now stretched back through time as well as distance,
 hungry shadows, unquiet guests who did not rest easy.
  In the darkened ballroom the clock under glass struck seven-thirty with a
 single musical note.
  A hoarse voice, made brutal with drink, shouted: 
s fuck!"
  Wendy, halfway across the lobby, jerked to a standstill.
  She looked at Danny on the stairs, still tossing the ball from hand to hand.
 "Did you bear something?"
  Danny only looked at her and continued to toss the ball from hand to hand.
  There would be little sleep for them that night, although they slept together
 behind a locked door.
  And in the dark, his eyes open, Danny thought:
  (He wants to be one of them and live forever. That
ll take him further up. If we
d rather do
 it in the mountains.)
  She had left the butcher knife, still wrapped in the towel, under the bed. She
 kept her hand close to it. They dozed off and on. The hotel creaked around them.
 Outside snow had begun to spit down from a sky like lead.

 now heavily shadowed with beardstubble and he had a hollow concentration-camp
 look.
  The boiler pressure gauge stood at two hundred and ten pounds per square inch.
 He fancied he could almost see the sides of the old patched and welded boiler

 ceilings and rooms aflame like the castle in the last reel of a Frankenstein

  He had raked a big pile of rain-dampened leaves under the branch where the
 wasps' nest rested, a deadlier fruit than the shrunken but tasty apples their
 tree usually produced in late September, which was then still half a month away.
 He lit the leaves. The day was clear and windless. The leaves smoldered but
 didn't really burn, and they made a smell-a fragrancethat had echoed back to him
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (250 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM

 each fall when men in Saturday pants and light Windbreakers raked leaves
 together and burned them. A sweet smell with a bitter undertone, rich and
 evocative. The smoldering leaves produced great rafts of smoke that drifted up
 to obscure the nest.
  Their father had let the leaves smolder all that afternoon, drinking beer on
 the porch and dropping the empty Black Label cans into his wife's plastic
 floorbucket while his two older sons flanked him and little Jacky sat on the
 steps at his feet, playing with his Bolo Bouncer and singing monotonously over
 and over: 

  At quarter of six, just before supper, Daddy had gone out to the apple tree
 with his sons grouped carefully behind him. In one hand he had a garden hoe. He
 knocked the leaves apart, leaving little clots spread around to smolder and die.
 Then he reached the hoe handle up, weaving and blinking, and after two or three
 tries he knocked the nest to the ground.
  The boys fled for the safety of the porch, but Daddy only stood over the nest,
 swaying and blinking down at it. Jacky crept back to see. A few wasps were
 crawling sluggishly over the paper terrain of their property, but they were not
 trying to fly. From the inside of the nest, the black and alien place, came a
 never-to-be-forgotten sound: a low, somnolent buzz, like the sound of high
tension wires.
  
t they try to sting you, Daddy?" he had asked.
  "The smoke makes em drunk, Jacky. Go get my gascan."
  He ran to fetch it. Daddy doused the nest with amber gasoline.
  "Now step away, Jacky, unless you want to lose your eyebrows."
  He had stepped away. From somewhere in the voluminous folds of his white
 overblouse, Daddy had produced a wooden kitchen match. He lit it with his
 thumbnail and flung it onto the nest. There had been a white-orange explosion,
 almost soundless in its ferocity. Daddy had stepped away, cackling wildly. The

 around the charred and blackened nest. From the hot interior had come the sound
 of wasp bodies popping like corn.
  The pressure gauge stood at two-twenty. A low iron wailing sound was building
 up in the guts of the thing. Jets of steam stood out erect in a hundred places
 like porcupine quills.

 breath. A warm tropical mist rose from beneath the boiler and veiled him. For a
 moment he could no longer see the dial but thought he must have waited too long;
 the groaning, clanking sound inside the boiler increased, followed by a series
 of heavy rattling sounds and the wrenching screech of metal.
  When some of the steam blew away he saw that the pressure gauge had dropped
 back to two hundred and was still sinking. The jets of steam escaping around the
 soldered patches began to lose their force. The wrenching, grinding sounds began
 to diminish.

 of it. His feet on the stair risers were quick and eager, the hurrying steps of
 a man who has come home from a long and bitter war. It was 5:20 A.M., MST.

                                   DAYLIGHT
  Danny awoke with a muffled gasp from a terrible dream. There had been an
 explosion. A fire. The Overlook was burning up. He and his mommy were watching
 it from the front lawn.
  Mommy had said: "Look, Danny, look at the hedges."
  He looked at them and they were all dead. Their leaves had turned a suffocant
 brown. The tightly packed branches showed through like the skeletons of half
dismembered corpses. And then his daddy had burst out of the Overlooks big
 double doors, and he was burning like a torch. His clothes were in flames, his
 skin had acquired a dark and sinister tan that was growing darker by the moment,
 his hair was a burning bush.
  That was when he woke up, his throat tight with fear, his hands clutching at
 the sheet and blankets. Had he screamed? He looked over at his mother. Wendy lay
 on her side, the blankets up to her chin, a sheaf of straw-colored hair lying
 against her cheek. She looked like a child herself. No, he hadn

 vacuous sort of humor.
  Was it so near, then?
  He threw the covers back and swung his feet out onto the floor. He kicked his
 slippers out from under the bed and put them on. He went to the door and pulled
 it open and hurried up to the main corridor, his slippered feet whispering on
 the nap of the carpet runner. He turned the corner.
  There was a man on all fours halfway down the corridor, between him and the
 stairs.
  Danny froze.
  The man looked up at him. His eyes were tiny and red. He was dressed in some
 sort of silvery, spangled costume. A dog costume, Danny realized. Protruding
 from the rump of this strange creation was a long and floppy tail with a puff on
 the end. A zipper ran up the back of the costume to the neck. To the left of him
 was a dog
s head, blank eyesockets above the muzzle, the mouth open in
 a meaningless snarl that showed the rug
s mouth and chin and cheeks were smeared with blood.
  He began to growl at Danny. He was grinning, but the growl was real. It was
 deep in his throat, a chilling primitive sound. Then he began to bark. His teeth
 were also stained red. He began to crawl toward Danny, dragging his boneless
 tail behind him. The costume dog

  "Let me by," Danny said.

 the dogman answered, and suddenly a
 fusillade of barks came from his grinning mouth. They were human imitations, but
 the savagery in them was real. The man's hair was dark, greased with sweat from
 his confining costume. There was a mixture of scotch and champagne on his
 breath.
  Danny flinched back but didn't run. 

  
 the dogman replied. His small red
 eyes were fixed attentively on Danny's face. He continued to grin.

  He began to prance skittishly forward, making little leaps and snarling.
  Danny's nerve broke. He fled back into the short hallway that led to their
 quarters, looking back over his shoulder. There was a series of mixed howls and
 barks and growls, broken by slurred mutterings and giggles.
  Danny stood in the hallway, trembling.
  
 the drunken dogman cried out from around the corner. His voice
 was both violent and despairing.

 off.
  Danny turned apprehensively to the closed bedroom door at the end of the
 hallway and walked quietly down to it. He opened it and poked his head through.
 His mommy was sleeping in exactly the same position. No one was hearing this but
 him.
  He closed the door softly and went back up to the intersection of their
 corridor and the main hall, hoping the dogman would be gone, the way the blood
 on the walls of the Presidential Suite had been gone. He peeked around the
 corner carefully.
  The man in the dog costume was still there. He had put his head back on and
 was now prancing on all fours by the stairwell, chasing his tail. He
 occasionally leaped off the rug and came down making dog grunts in his throat.
  

  These sounds came hollowly out of the mask's stylized snarling mouth, and
 among them were sounds that might have been sobs or laughter.
  Danny went back to the bedroom and sat down on his cot, covering his eyes with
 his hands. The hotel was running things now. Maybe at first the things that had
 happened had only been accidents. Maybe at first the things he had seen really
 were like scary pictures that couldn't hurt him. But now the hotel was
 controlling those things and they could hurt. The Overlook hadn't wanted him to
 go to his father. That might spoil all the fun. So it had put the dogman in his
 way, just as it had put the hedge animals between them and the road.
  But his daddy could come here. And sooner or later his daddy would.
  He began to cry, the tears rolling silently down his cheeks. It was too late.
 They were going to die, all three of them, and when the Overlook opened next
 late spring, they would be right here to greet the guests along with the rest of
 the spooks. The woman in the tub. The dogman. The horrible dark thing that had
 been in the cement tunnel. They would be-
  (Stop! Stop that now!)
  He knuckled the tears furiously from his eyes. He would try as hard as he
 could to keep that from happening. Not to himself, not to his daddy and mommy.
 He would try as hard as he could.
  He closed his eyes and sent his mind out in a high, hard crystal bolt.
                   (!!! DICK PLEASE COME QUICK WE'RE IN BAD
                             TROUBLE DICK WE NEED)
  And suddenly, in the darkness   behind his eyes the thing that chased him down
 the Overlook's dark halls in his dreams was there, right there, a huge creature
 dressed in white, its prehistoric club raised over its head:
  
ll make you stop it! You goddam puppy! I

  
 He jerked back to the reality of the bedroom, his eyes wide and staring,
 the screams tumbling helplessly from his mouth as his mother bolted awake,
 clutching the sheet to her breasts.

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  

  And they both heard the vicious, descending swing of the invisible club,
 cutting the air somewhere very close, then fading away to silence as he ran to
 his mother and hugged her, trembling like a rabbit in a snare.
  The Overlook was not going to let him call Dick. That might spoil the fun,
 too.
  They were alone.
  Outside the snow came harder, curtaining them off from the world.

  Dick Hallorann's flight was called at 6:45 A.M., EST, and the boarding clerk
 held him by Gate 31, shifting his flight bag nervously from hand to hand, until
 the last call at 6:55. They were both looking for a man named Carlton Vecker,
 the only passenger on TWA's flight 196 from Miami to Denver who hadn't checked
 in.
  
 the clerk said, and issued Hallorann a blue firstclass boarding pass.

 grinning stewardess tear his pass off and give him the stub.

 he said, and went down the aisle to a seat in the smoking
 section. He kept expecting the no-show Vecker to pop through the door like a
 jack-in-the-box at the last second. The woman in the seat by the window was
 reading You Can Be Your Own Best Friend with a sour, unbelieving expression on
 her face. Hallorann buckled his seat belt and then wrapped his large black hands
 around the seat's armrests and promised the absent Carlton Vecker that it would
 take him and five strong TWA flight attendants to drag him out of his seat. He
 kept his eye on his watch. It dragged off the minutes to the 7:00 takeoff time
 with maddening slowness.
  At 7:05 the stewardess informed them that there would be a slight delay while
 the ground crew rechecked one of the latches on the cargo door.
  
 Dick Hallorann muttered.
  The sharp-faced woman turned her sour, unbelieving expression on him and then
 went back to her book.
  He had spent the night at the airport, going from counter to counter--United,

 American, TWA, Continental, Braniff--haunting the ticket clerks. Sometime after
 midnight, drinking his eighth or ninth cup of coffee in the canteen, he had
 decided he was being an asshole to have taken this whole thing on his own
 shoulders. There were authorities. He had gone down to the nearest bank of
 telephones, and after talking to three different operators, he had gotten the
 emergency number of the Rocky Mountain National Park Authority.
  The man who answered the telephone sounded utterly worn out. Hallorann had
 given a false name and said there was trouble at the Overlook Hotel, west of
 Sidewinder. Bad trouble.
  He was put on hold.
  The ranger (Hallorann assumed he was a ranger) came back on in about five
 minutes.

  "Oh man, you stupid . . ." But his despair was too great to find a noun to go
 with the adjective. Suddenly, illumination. "Call them!" he cried.

  At 7:20 A.M. the TWA 747 backed lumberingly out of its stall, turned, and
 rolled out toward the runway. Hallorann let out a long, soundless exhale.
 Carlton Vecker, wherever you are, eat your heart out.
  Flight 196 parted company with the ground at 7:28, and at 7:31, as it gained
 altitude, the thought-pistol went off in Dick Hallorann's head again. His
 shoulders hunched uselessly against the smell of oranges and then jerked
 spasmodically. His forehead wrinkled, his mouth drew down in a grimace of pain.

  Jack stood in the dining room just outside the batwing doors leading into the
 Colorado Lounge, his head cocked, listening. He was smiling faintly.
  Around him, he could hear the Overlook Hotel coming to life.
  It was hard to say just how he knew, but he guessed it wasn't greatly
 different from the perceptions Danny had from time to time . . . like father,
 like son. Wasn't that how it was popularly expressed?
  It wasn't a perception of sight or sound, although it was very near to those
 things, separated from those senses by the filmiest of perceptual curtains. It
 was as if another Overlook now lay scant inches beyond this one, separated from
 the real world (if there is such a thing as a 
 Jack thought) but
 gradually coming into balance with it. He was reminded of the 3-D movies he'd
 seen as a kid. If you looked at -the screen without the special glasses, you saw
 a double image-the sort of thing he was feeling now. But when you put the
 glasses on, it made sense.

  All the hotel's eras were together now, all but this current one, the Torrance
 Era. And this would be together with the rest very soon now. That was good. That
 was very good.
  He could almost hear the self-important ding!ding! of the silver-plated bell
 on the registration desk, summoning bellboys to the front as men in the
 fashionable flannels of the 1920s checked in and men in fashionable 1940s
 double-breasted pinstripes checked out. There would be three nuns sitting in
 front of the fireplace as they waited for the check-out line to thin, and
 standing behind them, nattily dressed with diamond stickpins holding their blue
and-white-figured ties, Charles Grondin and Vito Gienelli discussed profit and
 loss, life and death. There were a dozen trucks in the loading bays out back,
 some laid one over the other like bad time exposures. In the east-wing ballroom,
 a dozen different business conventions were going on at the same time within
 temporal centimeters of each other. There was a costume ball going on. There
 were soirees, wedding receptions, birthday and anniversary parties. Men talking
 about Neville Chamberlain and the Archduke of Austria. Music. Laughter.
 Drunkenness. Hysteria. Little love, not here, but a steady undercurrent of
 sensuousness. And he could almost hear all of them together, drifting through
 the hotel and making a graceful cacophony. In the dining room where he stood,
 breakfast, lunch, and dinner for seventy years were all being served
 simultaneously just behind him. He could almost . . . no, strike the almost. He
 could hear them, faintly as yet, but clearly-the way one can hear thunder miles
 off on a hot summer's day. He could hear all of them, the beautiful strangers.
 He was becoming aware of them as they must have been aware of him from the very
 start.
  All the rooms of the Overlook were occupied this morning.
  A full house.
  And beyond the batwings, a low murmur of conversation drifted and swirled like
 lazy cigarette smoke. More sophisticated, more private. Low, throaty female
 laughter, the kind that seems to vibrate in a fairy ring around the viscera and
 the genitals. The sound of a cash register, its window softly lighted in the
 warm halfdark, ringing up the price of a gin rickey, a Manhattan, a depression
 bomber, a sloe gin fizz, a zombie. The jukebox, pouring out its drinkers'
 melodies, each one overlapping the other in time.
  He pushed the batwings open and stepped through

  As Lloyd made his drink, Jack looked over his shoulder. Every booth was
 occupied. Some of the occupants were dressed in costumes . . . a woman in gauzy
 harem pants and a rhinestone-sparkled brassiere, a man with a foxhead rising
 slyly out of his evening dress, a man in a silvery dog outfit who was tickling
 the nose of a woman in a sarong with the puff on the end of his long tail, to
 the general amusement of all.

 The loom of conversation had begun again, weaving and weaving.
  His new drink appeared in front of him.
  " Muchas gracias, Lloyd," he said, picking it up.
  "Always a pleasure to serve you, Mr. Torrance." Lloyd smiled.
  "You were always the best of them, Lloyd."
  "Why, thank you, sir."
  He drank slowly this time, letting it trickle down his throat, tossing a few
 peanuts down the chute for good luck.
  The drink was gone in no time, and he ordered another. Mr. President, I have
 met the martians and am pleased to report they are friendly. While Lloyd fixed
 another, he began searching his pockets for a quarter to put in the jukebox. He

  And here he was again, in the ballroom. The chandelier was lit and couples
 were circling all around them, some in costume and some not, to the smooth
 sounds of some postwar band--but which war? Can you be certain?
  No, of course not. He was certain of only one thing: he was dancing with a
 beautiful woman.
  She was tall and auburn-haired, dressed in clinging white satin, and she was
 dancing close to him, her breasts pressed softly and sweetly against his chest.
 Her white hand was entwined in his. She was wearing a small and sparkly cat's
eye mask and her hair had been brushed over to one side in a soft and gleaming
 fall that seemed to pool in the valley between their touching shoulders. Her
 dress was full-skirted but be could feel her thighs against his legs from time
 to time and had become more and more sure that she was smoothand-powdered naked
 under her dress,

 well; she snuggled even closer to him.

  The number ended. There was a spatter of applause and then the band swung into
 "Mood Indigo" with scarcely a pause.
  Jack looked over her bare shoulder and saw Derwent standing by the refreshment
 table. The girl in the sarong was with him. There were bottles of champagne in

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 ice buckets ranged along the white lawn covering the table, and Derwent held a
 foaming bottle in his hand. A knot of people had gathered, laughing. In front of
 Derwent and the girl in the sarong, Roger capered grotesquely on all fours, his
 tail dragging limply behind him. He was barking.
  "Speak, boy, speak!" Harry Derwent cried.
  "Rowf! Rowf!" Roger responded. Everyone clapped; a few of the men whistled.
  "Now sit up. Sit up, doggy!"
  Roger clambered up on his haunches. The muzzle of his mask was frozen in its
 eternal snarl. Inside the eyeholes, Roger
Rowf! Rowf!
Isn't Harry a card?
Everyone
 says so. He's AC/DC, you know. Poor Roger's only DC. He spent a weekend with
 Harry in Cuba once . . . oh, months ago. Now he follows Harry everywhere,
 wagging his little tail behind him.
But of course Harry never goes back for seconds . . . not on his DC side,
 anyway . . . and Roger is just wild. Harry told him if he came to the masked
 ball as a doggy, a cute little doggy, he might reconsider, and Roger is such a
 silly that he . . .

s face was surreal. "A drink?"
  "Martini."
  From behind him, another comber of laughter broke; Roger was howling to the
 tune of "Home on the Range." Someone was picking out accompaniment on the
 Steinway baby grand.
  "Here you are."
  The frosty cold glass was pressed into his hand. Jack drank gratefully,
 feeling the gin hit and crumble away the first inroads of sobriety.
  "Is it all right, sir?"
  "Fine."
  "Thank you, sir." The cart began to roll again.
  Jack suddenly reached out and touched the man

  "Yes. I do."

 certain responsibilities. Father Knows Best. They did not understand. That in
 itself was no crime, but they were willfully not understanding. He was not
 ordinarily a harsh man. But he did believe in punishment. And if his son and his
 wife had willfully set themselves against his wishes, against the things he knew
 were best for them, then didn

  "Bad dog!" Derwent was saying loudly, to a counterpoint of laughter. "Bad dog
 to piddle on the floor."
  "Of course you know," Grady said, leaning confidentially over the cart, "your
 son is attempting to bring an outside party into it. Your son has a very great
 talent, one that the manager could use to even further improve the Overlook, to

 very talent against us. He is willful, Mr. Torrance, Sir. Willful."
  "Outside party?" Jack asked stupidly.
  Grady nodded.
  "Who?"
  "A nigger," Grady said. "A nigger cook."
  "Hallorann?"
  "I believe that is his name, sir, yes."
  Another burst of laughter from behind them was followed by Roger saying
 something in a whining, protesting voice.
  "Yes! Yes! Yes!" Derwent began to chant. The others around him took it up, but
 before Jack could hear what they wanted Roger to do now, the band began to play
 again-the tune was "Tuxedo Junction," with a lot of mellow sax in it but not
 much soul.
  (Soul? Soul hasn
I was told you hadn't finished high school. But you don't talk like an

It's true that I left organized education very early, sir. But the manager

 agree, sir?
Yes,
For instance, you show a great interest in learning more about the Overlook
 Hotel. Very wise of you, sir. Very noble. A certain scrapbook was left in the

 waywardness.

But you must deal with him.

 snores.

 was 8:30 A.M.

                                    DENVER
  At 8:31 A.M., MST, a woman on TWA's Flight 196 burst into tears and began to
 bugle her own opinion, which was perhaps not unshared among some of the other
 passengers (or even the crew, for that matter), that the plane was going to
 crash.
  The sharp-faced woman next to Hallorann looked up from her book and offered a
 brief character analysis: 
 and went back to her book. She had downed two
 screwdrivers during the flight, but they seemed not to have thawed her at all.
  
s going to crash!" the woman was crying out shrilly. "Oh, I just know it
 is!"
  A stewardess hurried to her seat and squatted beside her. Hallorann thought to
 himself that only stewardesses and very young housewives seemed able to squat
 with any degree of grace; it was a rare and wonderful talent. He thought about
 this while the stewardess talked softly and soothingly to the woman, quieting
 her bit by bit.

 cabin at large. The stew gave her a final pat on the shoulder and stood up just
 as the 747 gave its worst lurch yet. The stewardess stumbled backward and landed
 in the lap of the man who had whoopsed into his paper, exposing a lovely length
 of nyloned thigh. The man blinked and then patted her kindly on the shoulder.
 She smiled back, but Hallorann thought the strain was showing. It had been one
 hell of a hard flight this morning.
  There was a little ping as the No SMOKING light reappeared.
  "This is the captain speaking," a soft, slightly southern voice informed them.
 "We

 a rough flight, for which I apologize. The landing may be a bit rough also, but
 we anticipate no real difficulty. Please observe the FASTEN SEAT BELTS and NO

 also hope--"
  Another hard bump rocked the plane and then dropped her with a sickening
 elevator plunge. Hallorann
--that we'll see you again on another TWA flight real soon.
Not bloody likely,
So silly,
When one has seen the horrors of a dirty little war . . . as you have . . . or
 sensed the degrading immorality of CIA dollar-diplomacy intervention . . . as I
 have . . . a rough landing pales into insignificance. Am I right, Mr. Hallorann?

  A thin white hand appeared over his.
  The woman with the sharp face had taken off her glasses. Without them her
 features seemed much softer.
  "It will be all right," she said.
  Hallorann made a smile and nodded.
  As advertised the plane came down hard, reuniting with the earth forcefully
 enough to knock most of the magazines out of the rack at the front and to send
 plastic trays cascading out of the galley like oversized playing cards. No one
 screamed, but Hallorann heard several sets of teeth clicking violently together
 like gypsy castanets.
  Then the turbine engines rose to a howl, braking the plane, and as they
 dropped in volume the pilot

 the crowd to the Hertz desk on the lower level. Outside the smoked glass windows
 he could see the snow still falling steadily. The gusting wind drove white
 clouds of it back and forth, and the people walking across to the parking area
 were struggling against it. One man lost his hat and Hallorann could commiserate
 with him as it whirled high, wide, and handsome. The man stared after it and

  Hallorann backed up, waited for a break in traffic, and continued on his way
 up Route 25. The signs informed him it was only a hundred miles to Cheyenne,
 Wyoming. If he didn't look out for his ramp, he'd wind up there.
  He inched his speed up to thirty-five but dared no more; already snow was
 threatening to clog his wiper blades and the traffic patterns were decidedly
 crazy. Twenty-mile detour. He cursed, and the feeling that time was growing
 shorter for the boy welled up in him again, nearly suffocating with its urgency.
 And at the same time he felt a fatalistic certainty that he would not be coming
 back from this trip.

  Around noon, after Danny had gone into the bathroom to use the toilet, Wendy
 took the towel-wrapped knife from under her pillow, put it in the pocket of her
 bathrobe, and went over to the bathroom door.
  "Danny?"

 more . . . and herself. Jack had lost his mind. They had sat together on Danny

 morning and had listened to him downstairs, bellowing and stumbling from one
 place to another. Most of it had seemed to come from the ballroom. Jack singing
 tuneless bits of song, Jack holding up one side of an argument, Jack screaming
 loudly at one point, freezing both of their faces as they stared into one

  She tried to stop the thought but it was too late.
  (and the voices.)
  Because from time to time it had not seemed that there was a solitary crazy
 man below them, shouting at and holding conversations with the phantoms in his
 own crumbling mind. From time to time, like a radio signal fading in and out,
 she had heard--or thought she had--other voices, and music, and laughter. At one
 moment she would hear Jack holding a conversation with someone named Grady (the
 name was vaguely familiar to her but she made no actual connection), making
 statements and asking questions into silence, yet speaking loudly, as if to make
 himself heard over a steady background racket. And then, eerily, other sounds
 would be there, seeming to slip into places-a dance band, people clapping, a man
 with an amused yet authoritative voice who seemed to be trying to persuade
 somebody to make a speech. For a period of thirty seconds to a minute she would
 hear this, long enough to grow faint with terror, and then it would be gone
 again and she would only hear Jack, talking in that commanding yet slightly
 slurred way she remembered as his drunk-speak voice. But there was nothing in
 the hotel to drink except cooking sherry. Wasn
t Jack imagine
 that he was drunk?
  She didn
s high,
 narrow windows. Heart thumping, she went to the open ballroom doors and looked
 in. It was empty and silent, the only sound that curious subaural echo that
 seems to linger in all large rooms, from the largest cathedral to the smallest
 hometown bingo parlor.
  She went back to the registration desk and stood undecided for a moment,
 listening to the wind howl outside. It was the worst storm so far, and it was
 still building up force. Somewhere on the west side a shutter latch had broken
 and the shutter banged back and forth with a steady flat cracking sound, like a
 shooting gallery with only one customer.
  (Jack, you really should take care of that. Before something gets in.)
  What would she do if he came at her right now, she wondered. If he should pop
 up from behind the dark, varnished registration desk with its pile of triplicate
 forms and its little silver-plated bell, like some murderous jack-in-the-box,
 pun intended, a grinning jack-in-the-box with a cleaver in one hand and no sense
 at all left behind his eyes. Would she stand frozen with terror, or was there
 enough of the primal mother in her to fight him for her son until one of them
 was dead? She didn

 worse--pale green tiles, gleaming Formica, spotless porcelain, glowing chrome

 felt as if it was one of Danny

 to enfold and comfort her. Danny had called for Mr. Hallorann, and upstairs,
 sitting next to Danny in fear as her husband ranted and raved below, that had
 seemed like the faintest of all hopes. But standing here, in Mr. Hallorann

 about rat or mouse droppings in the rice or flour or sugar.
  She opened the can and dropped the slightly jellied contents into a saucepan
plop. She went to the refrigerator and got milk and eggs for the omelet. Then to
 the walk-in freezer for cheese. All of these actions, so common and so much a
 part of her life before the Overlook had been a part of her life, helped to calm
 her.
  She melted butter in the frying pan, diluted the soup with milk, and then
 poured the beaten eggs into the pan.
  A sudden feeling that someone was standing behind her, reaching for her
 throat.
  She wheeled around, clutching the knife. No one there.
  (! Get ahold of yourself, girl!)
  She grated a bowl of cheese from the block, added it to the omelet, flipped
 it, and turned the gas ring down to a bare blue flame. The soup was hot. She put
 the pot on a large tray with silverware, two bowls, two plates, the salt and
 pepper shakers. When the omelet had puffed slightly, Wendy slid it off onto one
 of the plates and covered it.
  (Now back the way you came. Turn off the kitchen lights. Go through the inner
 office. Through the desk gate, collect two hundred dollars.)
  She stopped on the lobby side of the registration desk and set the tray down
 beside the silver bell. Unreality would stretch only so far; this was like some

 to freak them out.
  "Jack?" she called hesitantly.
  At that moment the wind rose in a gust, driving snow against the shutters, but
 it seemed to her that there had been something. A muffled sort of groan.
  "Jack?"
  No returning sound this time, but her eyes fell on something beneath the
 batwing doors of the Colorado Lounge, something that gleamed faintly in the
 subdued light. Jack

  Yet she was not angry with him; looking down at him she thought be looked like
 a horribly overtired little boy who bad tried to do too much and had fallen
 asleep in the middle of the living room floor. He had stopped drinking and it
 was not Jack who had made the decision to start again; there had been no liquor

 for him to start with . . . so where had it come from?
  Resting at every five or six feet along the horseshoe-shaped bar there were
 wine bottles wrapped in straw, their mouths plugged with candles. Supposed to
 look bohemian, she supposed. She picked one up and shook it, half-expecting to
 hear the slosh of gin inside it
  (new wine in old bottles)
  but there was nothing. She set it back down.
  Jack was stirring. She went around the bar, found the gate, and walked back on
 the inside to where Jack lay, pausing only to look at the gleaming chromium
 taps. They were dry, but when she passed close to them she could smell beer, wet
 and new, like a fine mist.
  As she reached Jack he rolled over, opened his eyes, and looked up at her. For
 a moment his gaze was utterly blank, and then it cleared.
  "Wendy?" he asked. "That you?"
  "Yes," she said. "Do you think you can make it upstairs? If you put your arms
 around me? Jack, where did you--"
  His hand closed brutally around her ankle.
  "Jack! What are you--"
  "Gotcha!" he said, and began to grin. There was a stale odor of gin and olives
 about him that seemed to set off an old terror in her, a worse terror than any
 hotel could provide by itself. A distant part of her thought that the worst
 thing was that it had all come back to this, she and her drunken husband.
  "Jack, I want to help."
  "Oh yeah. You and Danny only want to help." The grip on her ankle was crushing
 now. Still holding onto her, Jack was getting shakily to his knees. "You wanted
 to help us all right out of here. But now . . . I . . . gotcha!"
  "Jack, you

  
ll hurt more than your ankle, you bitch."
  The word stunned her so completely that she made no effort to move when he let
 go of her ankle and stumbled from his knees to his feet, where he stood swaying
 in front of her.
  "You never loved me," he said. "You want us to leave because you know that
bilities? No, I guess to fuck you didn
re just like my mother, you milksop bitch!"
  "Stop it," she said, crying. "You don
re saying. You
t know how, but you

  
t that right?"
  "No, no! We never planned anything! What are you-"
  "You liarl" he screamed. "Oh, I know how you do it! I guess I know that! When
 I say, `We
m going to do my job,
 and he says, `Yes, Daddy,
t figure it out? Did you think I was stupid?"
  She stared at him, unable to speak now. He was going to kill her, and then he
 was going to kill Danny. Then maybe the hotel would be satisfied and allow him
 to kill himself. Just like that other caretaker. Just like
  (Grady.)
  With almost swooning horror, she realized at last who it was that Jack had
 been conversing with in the ballroom.
  "You turned my son against me. That was the worst." His face sagged into lines
 of selfpity. "My little boy. Now he hates me, too. You saw to that. That was
 your plan all along, wasn
ve always been jealous, haven
t be satisfied unless you had all the cake, could
 you? Could you?"
  She couldn

s
 shoulders. Suddenly one of the hands that had been crushing her throat was gone
 as Jack cuffed Danny away with a snarl. The boy fell back against the empty
 shelves and dropped to the floor, dazed. The hand was on her throat again. The
 red flashes began to turn black.
  Danny was crying weakly. Her chest was burning. Jack was shouting into her
 face: "I
ll show you who is boss around here! I

  But all sounds were fading down a long dark corridor. Her struggles began to
 weaken. One of her hands fell away from his and dropped slowly until the arm was
 stretched out at right angles to her body, the hand dangling limply from the
 wrist like the hand of a drowning woman.
  It touched a bottle-one of the straw-wrapped wine bottles that served as
 decorative candleholders.
  Sightlessly, with the last of her strength, she groped for the bottle's neck
 and found it, feeling the greasy beads of wax against her hand.
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (282 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM

  (and U God if it slips)
  She brought it up and then down, praying for aim, knowing that if it only
 struck his shoulder or upper arm she was dead.
  But the bottle came down squarely on Jack Torrance's head, the glass
 shattering violently inside the straw. The base of it was thick and heavy, and
 it made a sound against his skull like a medicine ball dropped on a hardwood
 floor. He rocked back on his heels, his eyes rolling up in their sockets. The
 pressure on her throat loosened, then gave way entirely. He put his hands out,
 as if to steady himself, and then crashed over on his back.
  Wendy drew a long, sobbing breath. She almost fell herself, clutched the edge
 of the bar, and managed to hold herself up. Consciousness wavered in and out.
 She could hear Danny crying, but she had no idea where he was. It sounded like
 crying in an echo chamber. Dimly she saw dime-sized drops of blood falling to
 the dark surface of the bar-from her nose, she thought. She cleared her throat
 and spat on the floor. It sent a wave of agony up the column of her throat, but
 the agony subsided to a steady dull press of pain . . , just bearable.
  Little by little, she managed to get control of herself.
  She let go of the bar, turned around, and saw Jack lying full-length, the
 shattered bottle beside him. He looked like a felled giant. Danny was crouched
 below the lounge's cash register, both hands in his mouth, staring at his
 unconscious father.
  Wendy went to him unsteadily and touched his shoulder. Danny cringed away from
 her.
  

  
 he muttered in a husky old man's voice. 

  

  

  

  Pain ripping up her throat again. She winced against it. But he opened his
 eyes. They looked at her warily from bluish, shadowed sockets.
  She made herself speak calmly, her eyes never leaving his. Her voice was low
 and husky, almost a whisper. It hurt to talk. 
t

  Some kind of knowledge came slowly back into Danny's eyes.
  
 he whispered. 

  
 She broke off in a fit of coughing and
 spat out more blood. Her throat already felt puffed to twice its size. "The
 hotel made him drink it. Did you hear those people he was talking to this
 morning?"

  "Yes . . . the hotel people. . ."
  "I heard them too. And that means the hotel is getting stronger. It wants to
 hurt all of us. But I think . . , I hope . . , that it can only do that through
 your daddy. He was the only one it could catch. Are you understanding me, Danny?
 It

  
 He looked at Jack and groaned helplessly.
  
 And she was convinced that was true.
 More, she thought that Danny might be the one the hotel really wanted, the
 reason it was going so far . . . maybe the reason it was able to go so far. It
 might even be that in some unknown fashion it was Danny's shine that was
 powering it, the way a battery powers the electrical equipment in a car . . .
 the way a battery gets a car to start. If they got out of here, the Overlook
 might subside to its old semi-sentient state, able to do no more than present
 penny-dreadful horror slides to the more psychically aware guests who entered
 it. Without Danny it was not much more than an amusement park haunted house,
 where a guest or two might hear rappings or the phantom sounds of a masquerade
 party, or see an occasional disturbing thing. But if it absorbed Danny . , .
 Danny's shine or Iifeforce or spirit . . . whatever you wanted to call it . . .
 into itself--what would it be then?
  The thought made her cold all over.
  
 Danny said, and the tears began to flow again.
  
 she said, and hugged Danny tightly.

  Danny put the bargate up while she folded Jack's hands on his chest and
 listened to his breathing for a moment. It was slow but regular. From the smell
 of him she thought he must have drunk a great deal . . . and he was out of the
 habit. She thought it might be liquor as much as the crack on the head with the
 bottle that had put him out.
  She picked up his legs and began to drag him along the floor. She had been
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (284 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM

 married to him for nearly seven years, he had lain on top of her countless
 times-in the thousandsbut she had never realized how heavy he was. Her breath
 whistled painfully in and out of her hurt throat. Nevertheless, she felt better
 than she had in days. She was alive. Having just brushed so close to death, that
 was precious. And Jack was alive, too. By blind luck rather than plan, they had
 perhaps found the only way that would bring them all safely out.
  Panting harshly, she paused a moment, holding Jack's feet against her hips.
 The surroundings reminded her of the old seafaring captain's cry in Treasure
 Island after old blind Pew had passed him the Black Spot: h'e'll do em yeti
  And then she remembered, uncomfortably, that the old seadog had dropped dead
 mere seconds later.
  

  
ll manage." She began to drag him again. Danny was beside Jack. One of his
 hands had fallen off his chest, and Danny replaced it gently, with love.
  "Are you sure, Mommy?"
  "Yes. It

  
s like putting him in jail."
  "Only for awhile."
  "Okay, then. Are you sure you can do it?"
  "Yes."
  But it was a near thing, at that. Danny had been cradling his father
s greasy hair
 as they went into the kitchen. The back of his head struck the tiles, and Jack
 began to moan and stir.
  "You got to use smoke," Jack muttered quickly. "Now run and get me that
 gascan."
  Wendy and Danny exchanged tight, fearful glances.
  "Help me," she said in a low voice.
  For a moment Danny stood as if paralyzed by his father
s feet down and turned to fumble
 with the bolt. Danny looked down at Jack, who was lying limp and relaxed again.
 The shirttail had pulled out of the back of his pants as they dragged him and
 Danny wondered if Daddy was too drunk to be cold. It seemed wrong to lock him in
 the pantry like a wild animal, but he had seen what he tried to do to Mommy.
 Even upstairs he had known Daddy was going to do that. He had heard them arguing
 in his head.
  (If only we could all be out of here. Or if it was a dream I was having, back
 in Stovington. If only.)
  The bolt was stuck.
  Wendy pulled at it as hard as she could, but it wouldn

 no trouble at all when she had gone in to get the can of soup. Now it wouldn

 refrigerator; he would freeze or smother to death. But if they left him out and
 he woke up . . .
  Jack stirred again on the floor.

  Sobbing now, she yanked at the bolt with both hands.
  "Danny?" There was something softly menacing, if still blurry, in Jack

 this time Daddy was looking directly at him, his gaze strangely flat and
 speculative.
  "You copied it," Daddy told him. "I know you did, But it

  Wendy pushed the pantry door open with her knee, hardly noticing the pungent
 odor of dried fruit that wafted out. She picked up Jack
s eyes fluttered open again.
  "What are you doing? Wendy? What are you doing?"
  She stepped over him.
  He was quick; amazingly quick. One hand lashed out and she had to sidestep and
 nearly fall out the door to avoid his grasp. Still, he had caught a handful of
 her bathrobe and there was a heavy purring noise as it ripped., He was up on his
 hands and knees now, his hair hanging in his eyes, like some heavy animal. A
 large dog . . . or a lion.
  "Damn you both, I know what you want. But you

 she screamed. 

  He pushed the heavy wooden door shut with a slam, just as lack leaped. The
 door latched and Jack thudded uselessly against it.
  Danny's small hands groped at the bolt. Wendy was too far away to help; the
 issue of whether he would be locked in or free was going to be decided in two
 seconds. Danny missed his grip, found it again, and shot the bolt across just as
 the latch began to jiggle madly up and down below it. Then it stayed up and
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (286 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 there was a series of thuds as Jack slammed his shoulder against the door. The
 bolt, a quarter inch of steel in diameter, showed no signs of loosening. Wendy
 let her breath out slowly.
  
 Jack raged. 

  Danny's hand moved automatically toward the bolt. Wendy caught it and pressed
 it between her breasts.

  It was three in the afternoon of a long, long day.
  They were sitting on the big bed in their quarters. Danny was turning the
 purple VW model with the monster sticking out of the sun roof over and over in
 his hands, compulsively.
  They had heard Daddy's batterings at the door all the way across the lobby,
 the batterings and his voice, hoarse and petulantly angry in a weak-king sort of
 a way, vomiting promises of punishment, vomiting profanity, promising both of
 them that they would live to regret betraying him after he had slaved his guts
 out for them over the years.
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (287 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  Danny thought they would no longer be able to hear it upstairs, but the sounds
 of his rage carried perfectly up the dumb-waiter shaft: Mommy's face was pale,
 and there were horrible brownish bruises on her neck where Daddy had tried to...
  He turned the model over and over in his hands, Daddy's prize for having
 learned his reading lessons.
  (. . . where Daddy had tried to hug her too tight.)
  Mommy put some of her music on the little record player, scratchy and full of
 horns and flutes. She smiled at him tiredly. He tried to smile back and failed.
 Even with the volume turned up loud he thought he could still hear Daddy
 screaming at them and battering the pantry door like an animal in a zoo cage:
 What if Daddy had to go to the bathroom? What would he do then?
  Danny began to cry.
  Wendy turned the volume down on the record player at once, held him, rocked
 him on her lap.

t wake. But Danny did. Somehow the silence was worse, more ominous than
 the screams and the blows against the strong pantry door. Was Daddy asleep
 again? Or dead? Or what?
  (Did he get out?)
  Fifteen minutes later the silence was broken by a hard, grating, metallic
 rattle. There was a heavy grinding, then a mechanical humming. Wendy came awake
 with a cry.
  The elevator was running again.
  They listened to it, wide-eyed, hugging each other. It went from floor to
 floor, the grate rattling back, the brass door slamming open. There was

 laughter, drunken shouts, occasional screams, and the sounds of breakage.
  The Overlook was coming to life around them,
                                   << 48 >>
                                     JACK
  He sat on the floor of the pantry with his legs out in front of him, a box of
 Triscuit crackers between them, looking at the door. He was eating the crackers
 one by one, not tasting them, only eating them because he had to eat something.
 When he got out of here, he was going to need his strength. All of it.
  At this precise instant, he thought he had never felt quite so miserable in
 his entire life. His mind and body together made up a large-writ scripture of
 pain. His head ached terribly, the sick throb of a hangover. The attendant
 symptoms were there, too: his mouth tasted like a manure rake had taken a swing
 through it, his ears rung, his heart had an extra-heavy, thudding beat, like a
 tom-tom. In addition, both shoulders ached fiercely from throwing himself
 against the door and his throat felt raw and peeled from useless shouting. He
 had cut his right hand on the doorlatch.
  And when he got out of here, he was going to kick some ass.
  He munched the Triscuits one by one, refusing to give in to his wretched
 stomach, which wanted to vomit up everything. He thought of the Excedrins in his
 pocket and decided to wait until his stomach had quieted a bit. No sense
 swallowing a painkiller if you were going to throw it right back up. Have to use
 your brain. The celebrated Jack Torrance brain. Aren
t that really the central point?
 You know what happens when you drink, you know it from bitter experience. When
 you drink, you lose your wits.)
  He hurled the box of Triscuits across the small room. They struck a shelf of
 canned goods and fell to the floor. He looked at the box, wiped his lips with
 his hand, and then looked at his watch. It was almost six-thirty. He had been in
 here for hours. His wife had locked him in here and he

 driven his daddy to drink in the first place. And really . . . when you came

 had never actively tried to make Daddy a prisoner, the way Wendy had done to
 him. For Jack
s great novel: handcuffed to a dead man in
 the wasteland. Yes, that was better. Mentally and spiritually dead, his mother
 had been handcuffed to his father by matrimony. Still, Daddy had tried to do
 right as he dragged her rotting corpse through life. He had tried to bring the
 four children up to know right from wrong, to understand discipline, and above
 all, to respect their father.
  Well, they had been ingrates, all of them, himself included. And now he was
 paying the price; his own son had turned out to be an ingrate, too. But there
 was hope. He would get out of here somehow. He would chastise them both, and
 harshly. He would set Danny an example, so that the day might come when Danny
 was grown, a day when Danny would know what to do better than he himself had
 known.
  He remembered the Sunday dinner when his father had caned his mother at the
 table . . . how horrified he and the others had been. Now he could see how
 necessary that bad been, how his father had only been feigning drunkenness, how
 his wits had been sharp and alive underneath all along, watching for the
 slightest sign of disrespect.
  Jack crawled after the Triscuits and began to eat them again, sitting by the
 door she had so treacherously bolted. He wondered exactly what his father had
 seen, and how he had caught her out by his playacting. Had she been sneering at
 him behind her hand? Sticking her tongue out? Making obscene finger gestures? Or
 only looking at him insolently and arrogantly, convinced that he was too
 stupidly drunk to see? Whatever it had been, he had caught her at it, and he had

Yes, sir. Indeed it is. You appear to have been locked in.

  A pulse began to beat in the clockspring of veins at Jack

 She certainly seems to have gotten the better of you.
Perhaps, Mr. Torrance, we should have been dealing with her all along.

 death itself was outside that door.
  The feeling passed.
  He whispered: "Thank you, Grady. I swear you won
t."
  There was no answer. He became aware that all sounds had stopped except for
 the cold swooping of the wind outside.
  He pushed the pantry door open; the hinges squealed faintly.
  The kitchen was empty. Grady was gone. Everything was still and frozen beneath
 the cold white glare of the fluorescent bars. His eyes caught on the large
 chopping block where the three of them had eaten their meals.
  Standing on top of it was a martini glass, a fifth of gin, and a plastic dish
 filled with olives.
  Leaning against it was one of the roque mallets from the equipment shed.
  He looked at it for a long time.
  Then a voice much deeper and much more powerful than Grady

s odometer, he was less than three miles from Estes Park
 when he finally went off the road.
  In the hills, the snow was falling faster and more furiously than Hallorann
 had ever seen (which was, perhaps, not to say a great deal, since Hallorann had
 seen as little snow as he could manage in his lifetime), and the wind was
 blowing a capricious gale--now from the west, now backing around to the north,
 sending clouds of powdery snow across his field of vision, making him coldly
 aware again and again that if he missed a turn he might well plunge two hundred
 feet off the road, the Electra cartwheeling ass over teapot as it went down.
 Making it worse was his own amateur status as a winter driver. It scared him to
 have the yellow center line buried under swirling, drifting snow, and it scared
 him when the heavy gusts of wind came unimpeded through the notches in the hills
 and actually made the heavy Buick slew around. It scared him that the road
 information signs were mostly masked with snow and you could flip a coin as to
 whether the road was going to break right or left up ahead in the white drive-in
 movie screen he seemed to be driving through. He was scared, all right. He had
 driven in a cold sweat since climbing into the hills west of Boulder and Lyons,
 handling the accelerator and brake as if they were Ming vases. Between rock 

 roll tunes on the radio, the disc jockey constantly adjured motorists to stay
 off the main highways and under no conditions to go into the mountains, because
 many roads were impassable and all of them were dangerous. Scores of minor
 accidents had been reported, and two serious ones: a party of skiers in a VW
 microbus and a family that had been bound for Albuquerque through the Sangre de
 Cristo Mountains. The combined score on both was four dead and five wounded. "So
 stay off those roads and get into the good music here at KTLK," the jock
 concluded cheerily, and then compounded Hallorann

 his own bad luck. He would have to cope with it. He was afraid that if he

s nose was pointed directly between those headlamps. The plow was being
 none too choosy about keeping its own side of the road, and Hallorann had
 allowed the Buick to drift.
  The grinding roar of the plow
s testicles turned into two small wrinkled sacs filled with shaved
 ice. His guts seemed to have been transformed into a large mass of Silly Putty.
  Color was materializing out of the white now, snow-clotted orange. He could
 see the high cab, even the gesticulating figure of the driver behind the single
 long wiper blade. He could see the V shape of the plow
s left-hand embankment like pallid, smoking exhaust.
  WHAAAAAAAAA! the airhorn bellowed indignantly.
  He squeezed the accelerator like the breast of a muchloved woman and the Buick
 scooted forward and toward the right. There was no embankment over here; the
 plows headed up instead of down had only to push the snow directly over the
 drop.
  (The drop, ah yes, the drop--)
  The wingblades on Hallorann
s
 roof, flirted by with no more than an inch or two to spare. Until the plow had
 actually cleared him, Hallorann had thought a crash inevitable. A prayer which
 was half an inarticulate apology to the boy flitted through his mind like a torn
 rag.
  Then the plow was past, its revolving blue lights glinting and flashing in
 Hallorann
s steering wheel back to the left, but nothing doing.
 The scoot had turned into a skid, and the Buick was floating dreamily toward the
 lip of the drop, spurning snow from under its mudguards.
  He flicked the wheel back the other way, in the skid

 hard, and then felt a hard bump. In front of him the road was gone . . . he was
 looking into a bottomless chasm of swirling snow and vague greenish-gray pines
 far away and far below.
  (I
m going off)
  And that was where the car stopped, canting forward at a thirty-degree angle,
 the left fender jammed against a guardrail, the rear wheels nearly off the
 ground. When Hallorann tried reverse, the wheels only spun helplessly. His heart
 was doing a Gene Krupa drumroll.
  He got out--very carefully he got out--and went around to the Buick

s cap was perched on his head, and Hallorann could hardly
 believe it was staying on in the teeth of the wind.
  (Glue. It sure-God must be glue.)
  "Hi," he said. "Can you pull me back onto the road?"
  "Oh, I guess I could," the plow driver said. "What the hell you doing way up
 here, mister? Good way to kill your ass."
  "Urgent business."
  "Nothin is that urgent," the plow driver said slowly and kindly, as if
 speaking to a mental defective. "If you

 The driver shifted his stance companionably as if they were having
 a desultory chat on the back steps instead of standing in a blizzard halfway
 between hoot and holler, with Hallorann's car balanced three hundred feet above
 the tops of the trees below.

 the driver observed, not particularly perturbed.
 

  Hallorann got back behind the wheel, beginning to shake with delayed reaction
 now. His hands were numbed almost clear through. He had forgotten to bring
 gloves.
  The plow backed up to the rear of the Buick, and he saw the driver get out
 with a long coil of chain. Hallorann opened the door and shouted: 

  
 the driver shouted back.

  Hallorann nodded. 

  

  

  Cottrell disappeared into the blowing dimness with a final wave, his engineer
 cap still mounted perkily on his head. Hallorann got going again, the chains
 flailing at the snowcover on the road, finally digging in enough to start the
 Buick moving. Behind him, Howard Cottrell gave a final good-luck blast on his
 plow's airhorn, although it was really unnecessary; Hallorann could feel him
 wishing him good luck.
  That's two shines in one day, he thought, and that ought to be some kind of
 good omen. But he distrusted omens, good or bad. And meeting two people with the
 shine in one day (when he usually didn't run across more than four or five in
 the course of a year) might not mean anything. That feeling of finality, a
 feeling
  (like things are all wrapped up)
  he could not completely define was still very much with him. It was
  The Buick wanted to skid sideways around a tight curve and Hallorann jockeyed
 it carefully, hardly daring to breathe. He turned on the radio again and it was
 Aretha, and Aretha was just fine. He'd share his Hertz Buick with her any day.
  Another gust of wind struck the car, making it rock and slip around. Hallorann
 cursed it and hunched more closely over the wheel. Aretha finished her song and
 then the jock was on again, telling him that driving today was a good way to get
 killed.
  Hallorann snapped the radio off.
                                     * * *
  He did make it to Sidewinder, although he was four and a half hours on the
 road between Estes Park and there. By the time he got to the Upland Highway it
 was full dark, but the snowstorm showed no sign of abating. Twice he'd had to
 stop in front of drifts that were as high as his car's hood and wait for the
 plows to come along and knock holes in them. At one of the drifts the plow had
 come up on his side of the road and there had been another close call. The
 driver had merely swung around his car, not getting out to chew the fat, but he

 did deliver one of the two finger gestures that all Americans above the age of
 ten recognize, and it was not the peace sign.
  It seemed that as he drew closer to the Overlook, his need to hurry became
 more and more compulsive. He found himself glancing at his wristwatch almost
 constantly. The hands seemed to be flying along.
  Ten minutes after he had turned onto the Upland, he passed two signs. The
 whooping wind had cleared both of their snow pack so he was able to read them.
 SIDEWINDER 10, the first said. The second: ROAD CLOSED 12 MILES AHEAD DURING
 WINTER MONTHS.
  
 Hallorann muttered to himself. His dark face was strained and
 tense in the muted green glow of the dashboard instruments. It was ten after
 six. 

  And that was when it struck him full-force, the smell of oranges and the
 thought-force, heavy and hateful, murderous:
  (GET OUT OF HERE YOU DIRTY NIGGER THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS YOU NIGGER
 TURN AROUND TURN AROUND OR WE'LL KILL YOU HANG YOU UP FROM A TREE LIMB 
YOU
 FUCKING JUNGLE-BUNNY COON AND THEN BURN THE BODY THAT'S WHAT WE DO 
WITH NIGGERS
 SO TURN AROUND NOW)
  Hallorann screamed in the close confines of the car. The message did not come
 to him in words but in a series of rebuslike images that were slammed into his
 head with terrific force. He took his hands from the steering wheel to blot the
 pictures out.
  Then the car smashed broadside into one of the embankments, rebounded, slewed
 halfway around, and came to a stop. The rear wheels spun uselessly.
  Hallorann snapped the gearshift into park, and then covered his face with his
 hands. He did not precisely cry; what escaped him was an uneven huh-huh-huh
 sound. His chest heaved. He knew that if that blast had taken him on a stretch
 of road with a dropoff on one side or the other, he might well be dead now.
 Maybe that had been the idea. And it might hit him again, at any time. He would
 have to protect against it. He was surrounded by a red force of immense power
 that might have been memory. He was drowning in instinct.
  He took his hands away from his face and opened his eyes cautiously. Nothing.
 If there was something trying to scare him again, it wasn't getting through. He
 was closed off.
  Had that happened to the boy? Dear God, had that happened to the little boy?
  And of all the images, the one that bothered him the roost was that dull
 whacking sound, like a hammer splatting into thick cheese. What did that mean? .
  (Jesus, not that little boy. Jesus, please.)
  He dropped the gearshift lever into low range and fed the engine gas a little
 at a time. The wheels spun, caught, spun, and caught again. The Buick began to
 move, its headlights cutting weakly through the swirling snow. He looked at his

 watch. Almost six-thirty now. And he was beginning to feel that was very late
 indeed.

  Wendy Torrance stood indecisive in the middle of the bedroom, looking at her
 son, who had fallen fast asleep.
  Half an hour ago the sounds had ceased. All of them, all at once. The
 elevator, the party, the sound of room doors opening and closing. Instead of
 easing her mind it made the tension that had been building in her even worse; it
 was like a malefic hush before the storm's final brutal push. But Danny had
 dozed off almost at once; first into a light, twitching doze, and in the last
 ten minutes or so a heavier sleep. Even looking directly at him she could barely
 see the slow rise and fall of his narrow chest.
  She wondered when he had last gotten a full night's sleep, one without
 tormenting dreams or long periods of dark wakefulness, listening to revels that
 had only become audible-and visible-to her in the last couple of days, as the
 Overlook's grip on the three of them tightened.
  (Real psychic phenomena or group hypnosis?)
  She didn't know, and didn't think it mattered. What had been happening was
 just as deadly either way. She looked at Danny and thought
  (God grant he lie still)
  that if he was undisturbed, he might sleep the rest of the night through.
 Whatever talent he had, he was still a small boy and he needed his rest.
  It was Jack she had begun to worry about.,
  She grimaced with sudden pain, took her hand away from her mouth, and saw she
 had torn off one of her fingernails. And her nails were one thing she'd always
 tried to keep nice. They weren't long enough to be called hooks, but still
 nicely shaped and
  (and what are you worrying about your fingernails for?)
  She laughed a little, but it was a shaky sound, without amusement.
  First Jack had stopped howling and battering at the door. Then the party had
 begun again

 angle of time where they weren't meant to hear it?)
  counterpointed by the crashing, banging elevator. Then that had stopped. In

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 that new silence, as Danny had been falling asleep, she had fancied she heard
 low, conspiratorial voices coming from the kitchen almost directly below them.
 At first she had dismissed it as the wind, which could mimic many different
 human vocal ranges, from a papery deathbed whisper around the doors and window
 frames to a full-out scream around the eaves . . . the sound of a woman fleeing
 a murderer in a cheap melodrama. Yet, sitting stiffly beside Danny, the idea
 that it was indeed voices became more and more convincing.,
  Jack and someone else, discussing his escape from the pan
  try.
  Discussing the murder of his wife and son.
  It would be nothing new inside these walls; murder had been done here before.
  She had gone to the heating vent and had placed her ear against it, but at
 that exact moment the furnace had come on, and any sound was lost in the rush of
 warm air coming up from the basement. When the furnace had kicked off again,
 five minutes ago, the place was completely silent except for the wind, the
 gritty spatter of snow against the building, and the occasional groan of a
 board.
  She looked down at her ripped fingernail. Small beads of blood were oozing up
 from beneath it.
  (lack's gotten out.)
  (Don't talk nonsense.)
  (Yes, he's out. He's gotten a knife from the kitchen or maybe the meat
 cleaver. He's on his way up here right now, walking along the sides of the
 risers so the stairs won't creak.)
  (! You're insane !)
  Her lips were trembling, and for a moment it seemed that she must have cried
 the words out loud. But the silence held.
  She felt watched.
  She whirled around and stared at the night-blackened window, and a hideous
 white face with circles of darkness for eyes was gibbering in at her, the face
 of a monstrous lunatic that had been hiding in these groaning walls all along
  It was only a pattern of frost on the outside of the glass.
  She let her breath out in a long, susurrating whisper of fear, and it seemed
 to her that she heard, quite clearly this time, amused titters from somewhere.
  (You're jumping at shadows. It's bad enough without that. By tomorrow morning,
 you'll be ready for the rubber room.)
  There was only one way to allay those fears and she knew what it was.
  She would have to go down and make sure Jack was still in the pantry.
  Very simple. Go downstairs. Have a peek. Come back up. Oh, by the way, stop
 and grab the tray on the registration counter. The omelet would be a washout,
 but the soup could be reheated on the hotplate by Jack's typewriter.
  (Oh yes and don't get killed if he's down there with a knife.)
  She walked to the dresser, trying to shake off the mantle of fear that lay on
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (300 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 her. Scattered across the dresser's top was a pile of change, a stack of
 gasoline chits for the hotel truck, the two pipes Jack brought with him
 everywhere but rarely smoked . . . and his key ring.
  She picked it up, held it in her hand for a moment, and then put it back down.
 The idea of locking the bedroom door behind her had occurred, but it just didn't
 appeal. Danny was asleep. Vague thoughts of fire passed through her mind, and
 something else nibbled more strongly, but she let it go:
  Wendy crossed the room, stood indecisively by the door for a moment, then took
 the knife from the pocket of her robe and curled her right hand around the
 wooden haft,:
  She pulled the door open.
  The short corridor leading to their quarters was bare. The electric wall
 flambeaux all shone brightly at their regular intervals, showing off the rug's
 blue background and sinuous, weaving pattern.
  (See? No boogies here.)
  (No, of course not. They want you out. They want you to do something silly and
 womanish, and that is exactly what you are doing.)
  She hesitated again, miserably caught, not wanting to leave Danny and the
 safety of the apartment and at the same time needing badly to reassure herself
 that Jack was still .
  safely packed away.
  (Of course he is.)
  (But the voices)
  (There were no voices. It was your imagination. It was the wind.)
  
t the wind."
  The sound of her own voice made her jump. But the deadly certainty in it made
 her go forward. The knife swung by her side, catching angles of light and
 throwing them on the silk wallpaper. Her slippers whispered against the carpet
s hesitation she rounded the corner and began down the main
 corridor. Each step toward the shadowy stairwell increased her dread and made
 her aware that she was leaving her sleeping son behind, alone and unprotected.
 The sound of her slippers against the carpet seemed louder and louder in her
 ears; twice she looked back over her shoulder to convince herself that someone
 wasn

  The light from the first-floor hall filtered a dull yellow down here, and she
 remembered that she would have to turn on the lobby lights either beside the
 entrance to the dining room or inside the manager
t remember.
  Below her, in the lobby, highbacked chairs hulked in pools of shadow. The
 glass in the lobby doors was pressed white with a uniform blanket of drifted
 snow. Brass studs in the sofa cushions gleamed faintly like cat
s office and into the kitchen. Gleaming dull silver, she could see the
 intended lunch tray.
  Then the clock began to strike, little tinkling notes.
  Wendy stiffened, her tongue rising to the roof of her mouth. Then she relaxed.
 It was striking eight, that was all. Eight o

 her breath had been knocked loose. She could only force out a weak whimper,
 hardly a sound at all.
  "Now. Now, by Christ," he said, grinning. He kicked the hassock out of his
 way. "I guess you

  The mallet whickered down. Wendy rolled to her left, her robe tangling above
 her knees. Jack's hold on the mallet was jarred loose when it hit the floor. He
 had to stoop and pick it up, and while he did she ran for the stairs, the breath
 at last sobbing back into her. Her stomach was a bruise of throbbing pain.
  
 he said through his grin, and began to come after her. 
ll get what

  She heard the mallet whistle through the air and then agony exploded on her
 right side as the mallet-head took her just below the line of her breasts,
 breaking two ribs. She fell forward on the steps and new agony ripped her as she
 struck on the wounded side. Yet instinct made her roll over, roll away, and the
 mallet whizzed past the side of her face, missing by a naked inch. It struck the
 deep pile of the stair carpeting with a muffled thud. That was when she saw the
 knife, which had been jarred out of her hand by her fall. It lay glittering on
 the fourth stair riser.
  
 he repeated. The mallet came down. She shoved herself upward and it
 landed just below her kneecap. Her lower leg was suddenly on fire. Blood began
 to trickle down her calf. And then the mallet was coming down again. She jerked
 her head away from it and it smashed into the stair riser in the hollow between
 her neck and shoulder, scraping away the flesh from her ear.
  He brought the mallet down again and this time she rolled toward him, down the
 stairs, inside the arc of his swing. A shriek escaped her as her broken ribs
 thumped and grated. She struck his shins with her body while he was offbalance
 and he fell backward with a yell of anger and surprise, his feet jigging to keep
 their purchase on the stair riser. Then he thumped to the floor, the mallet
 flying from his hand. He sat up, staring at her for a moment with shocked eyes.
  
ll kill you for that," he said.
  He rolled over and stretched out for the handle of the mallet. Wendy forced
 herself to her feet. Her left leg sent bolt after bolt of pain all the way up to
 her hip. Her face was ashy pale but set. She leaped onto his back as his hand
 closed over the shaft of the Toque mallet.
  "Oh dear God!" she screamed to the Overlook
s voice came from behind
 and below her. He said thickly: "You bitch. You killed me."
  Terror as black as midnight swept through her. She looked over her shoulder
 and saw Jack getting slowly to his feet.
  His back was bowed over, and she could see the handle of the kitchen knife
 sticking out of it. His eyes seemed to have contracted, almost to have lost
 themselves in the pale, sagging folds of the skin around them. He was grasping
 the roque mallet loosely in his left hand. The end of it was bloody. A scrap of
 her pink terrycloth robe stuck almost in the center.
  "I
 he whispered, and began to stagger toward the
 stairs.
  Whimpering with fear, she began to pull herself upward again. Ten steps, a
 dozen, a baker's dozen. But still the first-floor hallway looked as far above
 her as an unattainable mountain peak. She was panting now, her side shrieking in
 protest. Her hair swung wildly back and forth in front of her face. Sweat stung
 her eyes. The ticking of the domed clock in the ballroom seemed to fill her
 cars, and counterpointing it, Jack's panting, agonized gasps as he began to
 mount the stairs.

                               HALLORANN ARRIVES
  Larry Durkin was a tall and skinny man with a morose face overtopped with a
 luxuriant mane of red hair. Hallorann had caught him just as he was leaving the
 Conoco station, the morose face buried deeply inside an army-issue parka. He was
 reluctant to do any more business that stormy day no matter how far Hallorann

 had come, and even more reluctant to rent one of his two snowmobiles out to this
 wild-eyed black man who insisted on going up to the old Overlook. Among people
 who had spent most of their lives in the little town of Sidewinder, the hotel
 had a smelly reputation. Murder had been done up there. A bunch of hoods had run
 the place for a while, and cutthroat businessmen had run it for a while, too.
 And things had been done up at the old Overlook that never made the papers,
 because money has a way of talking. But the people in Sidewinder had a pretty
 good idea. Most of the hotel's chambermaids came from here, and chambermaids see
 a lot.
  But when Hallorann mentioned Howard Cottrell's name and showed Durkin the tag
 inside one of the blue mittens, the gas station owner thawed.
  
 Durkin asked, unlocking one of the garage bays and
 leading Hallorann inside.

 thought he was plumb out of it." He flicked a switch and a bank of very old and
 very dirty fluorescents buzzed wearily into life. "Now what in the tarnal

I don't know,
Look,
Please. I need to go up there and I have to have a
 snowmobile to get there. I'll pay your price, but for God's sake let me get on
 with my business!
All right,
If Howard sent you, that's good
 enough. You take this ArcticCat. I'll put five gallons of gas in the can. Tank's
 full. She'll get you up and back down, I guess.

  Hallorann nodded.
  
 Durkin told him, and ran back into the garage bay.
  While he was gone, Hallorann turned the key in the ignition and pumped the
 throttle a little. The snowmobile coughed into brash, choppy life.
  Durkin came back with a red and black ski mask.
  
 he shouted.
  Hallorann dragged it on. It was a tight fit, but it cut the last of the
 numbing wind off from his cheeks and forehead and chin.
  Durkin leaned close to make himself heard.

  "Okay. Thanks for everything."
  "You watch out!" Durkin yelled. "Stay on the road!"
  Hallorann nodded and twisted the throttle slowly. The snowmobile purred
 forward, the headlamp cutting a clean cone of light through the thickly falling
 snow. He saw Durkin
s headlamp, terror closed in on him again, a childlike fear, dismal
 and disheartening. He had never felt so alone. For several minutes, as the few
 lights of Sidewinder dwindled away and disappeared in the rearview, the urge to
 turn around and go back was almost insurmountable. He reflected that for all of
 Durkin
s boy, he had not offered to take the other
 snowmobile and come with him.
  (That place has got a bad reputation around here.)
  Clenching his teeth, he turned the throttle higher and watched the needle on
 the speedometer climb past forty and settle at forty-five. He seemed to be going
 horribly fast and yet he was afraid it wasn
d give a hundred bucks for a pair of ski pants.)
  As each mile turned over, his terror grew--as if the place had a poison
 atmosphere that thickened as you neared it. Had it ever been like this before?
 He had never really liked the Overlook, and there had been others who shared his
 feeling, but it had never been like this.
  He could feel the voice that had almost wrecked him outside of Sidewinder
 still trying to get in, to get past his defenses to the soft meat inside. If it
 had been strong twenty-five miles back, how much stronger would it be now? He
 couldn
s steering gear
 hard right and it swung around, tilting as it did so. From underneath came the
 harsh grating sound of the snowtread on rock. He thought the snowmobile was
 going to dump him, and it did totter on the knife-edge of balance before half
driving, half-skidding back down to the more or less level surface of the snow
buried road. Then the dropoff was ahead of him, the headlamp showing an abrupt
 end to the snowcover and darkness beyond that. He turned the snowmobile the
 other way, a pulse beating sickly in his throat.
  (Keep it on the road Dicky old chum.)
  He forced himself to turn the throttle up another notch. Now the speedometer
 needle was pegged just below fifty. The wind howled and roared. The headlamp
 probed the dark.
  An unknown length of time later, he came around a driftbanked curve and saw a
 glimmering flash of light ahead. Just a glimpse, and then it was blotted out by
 a rising fold of land. The glimpse was so brief he was persuading himself it had
 been wishful thinking when another turn brought it in view again, slightly
 closer, for another few seconds. There was no question of its reality this time;
 he had seen it from just this angle too many times before. It was the Overlook.
 There were lights on the first floor and lobby levels, it looked like.
  Some of his terror--the part that had to do with driving off the road or
 wrecking the snowmobile on an unseen curve--melted entirely away. The snowmobile
 swept surely into the first half of an S curve that he now remembered
 confidently foot for foot, and that was when the headlamp picked out the
  (oh dear Jesus god what is it)
  in the road ahead of him. Limned in stark blacks and whites, Hallorann first
 thought it was some hideously huge timberwolf that had been driven down from the
 high country by the storm. Then, as he closed on it, he recognized it and horror
 closed his throat.
  Not a wolf but a lion. A hedge lion.
  Its features were a mask of black shadow and powdered snow, its haunches wound
 tight to spring. And it did spring, snow billowing around its pistoning rear
 legs in a silent burst of crystal glitter.
  Hallorann screamed and twisted the handlebars hard right, ducking low at the
 same time. Scratching, ripping pain scrawled itself across his face, his neck,
 his shoulders. The ski mask was torn open down the back. He was hurled from the
 snowmobile. He hit the snow, plowed through it, rolled over.
  He could feel it coming for him. In his nostrils there was a bitter smell of
 green leaves and holly. A huge hedge paw batted him in the small of the back and
 he flew ten feet through the air, splayed out like a rag doll. He saw the
 snowmobile, riderless, strike the embankment and rear up, its headlamp searching

 the sky. It fell over with a thump and stalled.
  Then the hedge lion was on him. There was a crackling, rustling sound.
 Something raked across the front of the parka, shredding it. It might have been
 stiff twigs, but Hallorann knew it was claws.
  "You
 Hallorann screamed at the circling, snarling hedge lion.
 
re not there at all!" He struggled to his feet and made it halfway to the
 snowmobile before the lion lunged, batting him across the head with a needle
tipped paw. Hallorann saw silent, exploding lights.
  "Not there," he said again, but it was a fading mutter. His knees unhinged and
 dropped him into the snow. He crawled for the snowmobile, the right side of his
 face a scarf of blood. The lion struck him again, rolling him onto his back like
 a turtle. It roared playfully.
  Hallorann struggled to reach the snowmobile. What he needed was there. And
 then the lion was on him again, ripping and clawing.
                                   << 52 >>
                                WENDY AND JACK
  Wendy risked another glance over her shoulder. Jack was on the sixth riser,
 clinging to the banister much as she was doing herself. He was still grinning,
 and dark blood oozed slowly through the grin and slipped down the line of his
 jaw. He bared his teeth at her.
  "I
 He struggled
 up another riser.
  Panic spurred her, and the ache in her side diminished a little. She pulled
 herself up as fast as she could regardless of the pain, yanking convulsively at
 the banister. She reached the top and threw a glance behind her.
  He seemed to be gaining strength rather than losing it. He was only four
 risers from the top, measuring the distance with the rogue mallet in his left
 hand as he pulled himself up with his right.
  
 he panted through his bloody grin, as if reading her mind.
 

  She fled stumblingly down the main corridor, hands pressed to her side.
  The door to one of the rooms jerked open and a man with a green ghoulmask on
 popped out.

 waxed string of a party-favor. There was an echoing bang and suddenly crepe
 streamers were drifting all around her. The man in the ghoulmask cackled and

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 slammed back into his room. She fell forward onto the carpet, full-length. Her
 right side seemed to explode with pain, and she fought off the blackness of
 unconsciousness desperately. Dimly she could hear the elevator running again,
 and beneath her splayed fingers she could see that the carpet pattern appeared
 to move, swaying and twining sinuously.
  The mallet slammed down behind her and she threw herself forward, sobbing.
 Over her shoulder she saw Jack stumble forward, overbalance, and bring the
 mallet down just before he crashed to the carpet, expelling a bright splash of
 blood onto the nap.
  The mallet head struck her squarely between the shoulder blades and for a
 moment the agony was so great that she could only writhe, hands opening and
 clenching. Something inside her had snapped--she had heard it clearly, and for a
 few moments she was aware only in a muted, muffled way, as if she were merely
 observing these things through a cloudy wrapping of gauze.
  Then full consciousness came back, terror and pain with it.
  Jack was trying to get up so he could finish the job.
  Wendy tried to stand and found it was impossible. Electric bolts seemed to
 course up and down her back at the effort. She began to crawl along in a
 sidestroke motion. Jack was crawling after her, using the roque mallet as a
 crutch or a cane.
  She reached the comer and pulled herself around it, using her hands to yank at
 the angle of the wall. Her terror deepened--she would not have believed that
 possible, but it was. It was a hundred times worse not to be able to see him or
 know how close he was getting. She tore out fistfuls of the carpet napping
 pulling herself along, and she was halfway down this short hall before she
 noticed the bedroom door was standing wide open.
  (Danny! O Jesus)
  She forced herself to her knees and then clawed her way to her feet, fingers
 slipping over the silk wallpaper. Her nails pulled little strips of it loose.
 She ignored the pain and halfwalked, half-shambled through the doorway as Jack
 came around the far corner and began to lunge his way down toward the open door,
 leaning on the roque mallet.
  She caught the edge of the dresser, held herself up against it, and grabbed
 the doorframe.
  Jack shouted at her: "Don
t you dare
 shut it!"
  She slammed it closed and shot the bolt. Her left hand pawed wildly at the
 junk on the dresser, knocking loose coins onto the floor where they rolled in
 every direction. Her hand seized the key ring just as the mallet whistled down
 against the door, making it tremble in its frame. She got the key into the lock
 on the second stab and twisted it to the right. At the sound of the tumblers
 falling, Jack screamed. The mallet came down against the door in a volley of
 booming blows that made her flinch and step back. How could he be doing that
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (311 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM

 with a knife in his back? Where was he finding the strength? She wanted to
 shriek Why aren

  "Danny, honey, you

  But the bed was empty.
  When he had begun to sleep more soundly, she had thrown the blankets and one
 of the quilts over him. Now they were thrown back.
  
ll get you!" Jack howled. "I
 Every other word was
 punctuated with a blow from the roque hammer, yet Wendy ignored both. All of her
 attention was focused on that empty bed.
  

  
 she whispered.
  Of course . . . when Jack had attacked her. It had come through to him, as
 violent emotions always seemed to. Perhaps he'd even seen the whole thing in a
 nightmare. He was hiding.
  She fell clumsily to her knees, enduring another bolt of pain from her swollen
 and bleeding leg, and looked under the bed. Nothing there but dustballs and
 Jack's bedroom slippers.
  Jack screamed her name, and this time when he swung the mallet, a long
 splinter of wood jumped from the door and clattered off the hardwood planking.
 The next blow brought a sickening, splintering crack, the sound of dry kindling
 under a hatchet. The bloody mallet head, now splintered and gouged in its own
 right, bashed through the new hole in the door, was withdrawn, and came down
 again, sending wooden shrapnel flying across the room.
  Wendy pulled herself to her feet again using the foot of the bed, and hobbled
 across the room to the closet. Her broken ribs stabbed at her, making her groan.
  

  She brushed the hung garments aside frantically; some of them slipped their
 hangers and ballooned gracelessly to the floor. He was not in the closet.
  She hobbled toward the bathroom and as she reached the door she glanced back
 over her shoulder. The mallet crashed through again, widening the hole, and then
 a hand appeared, groping for the bolt. She saw with horror that she had left
 Jack's key ring dangling from the lock.
  The hand yanked the bolt back, and as it did so it struck the bunched keys.
 They jingled merrily. The hand clutched them victoriously.
  With a sob, she pushed her way into the bathroom and slammed the door just as
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (312 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 the bedroom door burst open and Jack charged through, bellowing.
  Wendy ran the bolt and twisted the spring lock, looking around desperately.
 The bathroom was empty. Danny wasn't here, either. And as she caught sight of
 her own bloodsmeared, horrified face in the medicine cabinet mirror, she was
 glad. She had never believed that children should be witness to the little
 quarrels of their parents. And perhaps the thing that was now raving through the
 bedroom, overturning things and smashing them, would finally collapse before it
 could go after her son. Perhaps, she thought, it might be possible for her to
 inflict even more damage on it . . . kill it, perhaps.
  Her eyes skated quickly over the bathroom's machine-produced porcelain
 surfaces, looking for anything that might serve as a weapon. There was a bar of
 soap, but even wrapped in a towel she didn't think it would be lethal enough.
 Everything else was bolted down. God, was there nothing she could do?
  Beyond the door, the animal sounds of destruction went on and on, accompanied
 by thick shouts that they would

 They were 

 the both of them.
  There was a thump as her record player was overturned, a hollow crash as the
 secondhand TV's picture tube was smashed, the tinkle of windowglass followed by
 a cold draft under the bathroom door. A dull thud as the mattresses were ripped
 from the twin beds where they had slept together, hip to hip. Boomings as Jack
 struck the walls indiscriminately with the mallet.
  There was nothing of the real Jack in that howling, maundering, petulant
 voice, though. It alternately whined in tones of selfpity and rose in lurid
 screams; it reminded her chillingly of the screams that sometimes rose in the
 geriatrics ward of the hospital where she had worked summers as a high school
 kid. Senile dementia. Jack wasn't out there anymore. She was hearing the
 lunatic, raving voice of the Overlook itself.
  The mallet smashed into the bathroom door, knocking out a huge chunk of the
 thin paneling. Half of a crazed and working face stared in at her. The mouth and
 cheeks and throat were lathered in blood, the single eye she could see was tiny
 and piggish and glittering.
  
 it panted at her through its grin. The mallet
 descended again, knocking wood splinters into the tub and against the reflecting
 surface of the medicine cabinet
  (!! The medicine cabinet !!)
  A desperate whining noise began to escape her as she whirled, pain temporarily
 forgotten, and threw the mirror door of the cabinet back. She began to paw
 through its contents. Behind her that hoarse voice bellowed: 
 It was demolishing the door in a machinelike frenzy.
  Bottles and jars fell before her madly searching fingerscough syrup, Vaseline,
 Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo, hydrogen peroxide, benzocaine--they fell into
 the sink and shattered.

  Her hand closed over the dispenser of double-edged razor blades just as she
 heard the hand again, fumbling for the bolt and the spring lock.
  She slipped one of the razor blades out, fumbling at it, her breath coming in
 harsh little gasps. She had cut the ball of her thumb. She whirled around and
 slashed at the hand, which had turned the lock and was now fumbling for the
 bolt.
  Jack screamed. The hand was jerked back.
  Panting, holding the razor blade between her thumb and index finger, she
 waited for him to try again. He did, and she slashed. He screamed again, trying
 to grab her hand, and she slashed at him again. The razor blade turned in her
 hand, cutting her again, and dropped to the tile floor by the toilet.
  Wendy slipped another blade out of the dispenser and waited.
  Movement in the other room-
  (?? going away ??)
  And a sound coming through the bedroom window. A motor. A high, insectile
 buzzing sound.
  A roar of anger from Jack and then-yes, yes, she was sure of it-he was leaving
 the caretaker's apartment, plowing through the wreckage and out into the hall.
  (?? Someone coming a ranger Dick Hallorann ??)
  
 she muttered brokenly through a mouth that seemed filled with broken
 sticks and old sawdust. 

  She had to leave now, had to go find her son so they could face the rest of
 this nightmare side by side. She reached out and fumbled at the bolt. Her arm
 seemed to stretch for miles. At last she got it to come free. She pushed the
 door open, staggered out, and was suddenly overcome by the horrible certainty
 that Jack had only pretended to leave, that he was lying in wait for her:
  Wendy looked around. The room was empty, the living room too. Jumbled, broken
 stuff everywhere.
  The closet? Empty.
  Then the soft shades of gray began to wash over her and she fell down on the
 mattress Jack had ripped from the bed, semiconscious.

                              HALLORANN LAID LOW
  Hallorann reached the overturned snowmobile just as, a mile and a half away,
 Wendy was pulling herself around the corner and into the short hallway leading

 to the caretaker's apartment.
  It wasn't the snowmobile he wanted but the gascan held onto the back by a pair
 of elastic straps. His hands, still clad in Howard Cottrell's blue mittens,
 seized the top strap and pulled it free as the hedge lion roared behind him--a
 sound that seemed to be more in his head than outside of it. A hard, brambly
 slap to his left leg, making the knee sing with pain as it was driven in a way
 the joint had never been expected to bend. A groan escaped Hallorann's clenched
 teeth. It would come for the kill any time now, tired of playing with him.
  He fumbled for the second strap. Sticky blood ran in his eyes.
  (Roar! Slap!)
  That one raked across his buttocks, almost tumbling him over and away from the
 snowmobile again. He held on--no exaggeration--for dear life.
  Then he had freed the second strap. He clutched the gascan to him as the lion
 struck again, rolling him over on his back. He saw it again, only a shadow in
 the darkness and falling snow, as nightmarish as a moving gargoyle. Hallorann
 twisted at the can's cap as the moving shadow stalked him, kicking up snowpuffs.
 As it moved in again the cap spun free, releasing the pungent smell of the
 gasoline.
  Hallorann gained his knees and as it came at him, lowslung and incredibly
 quick, he splashed it with the gas.
  There was a hissing, spitting sound and it drew back.
  
 Hallorann cried, his voice shrill and breaking. 

  The lion came at him again, still spitting angrily. Hallorann splashed it
 again but this time the lion didn't give. It charged ahead. Hallorann sensed
 rather than saw its head angling at his face and he threw himself backward,
 partially avoiding it. Yet the lion still hit his upper rib cage a glancing
 blow, and a flare of pain struck there. Gas gurgled out of the can, which he
 still held, and doused his right hand and arm, cold as death.
  Now he lay on his back in a snow angel, to the right of the snowmobile by
 about ten paces. The hissing lion was a bulking presence to his left, closing in
 again. Hallorann thought he could see its tail twitching.
  He yanked Cottrell's mitten off his right hand, tasting sodden wool and
 gasoline. He ripped up the hem of the parka and jammed his hand into his pants
 pocket. Down in there, along with his keys and his change, was a very battered
 old Zippo lighter. He had bought it in Germany in 1954. Once the hinge had
 broken and he had returned it to the Zippo factory and they had repaired it
 without charge, just as advertised.
  A nightmare flood of thoughts flooding through his mind in a split second.
  (Dear Zippo my lighter was swallowed by a crocodile dropped front an airplane
 lost in the Pacific trench saved me from a Kraut bullet in the Battle of the
 Bulge dear Zippo if this fucker doesn't go that lion is going to rip my head
 off)
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (315 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  The lighter was out. He clicked the hood back. The lion, rushing at him, a
 growl like ripping cloth, his finger flicking the striker wheel, spark, flame,
  (my hand)
  his gasoline-soaked hand suddenly ablaze, the flames running up the sleeve of
 the parka, no pain, no pain yet, the lion shying from the torch suddenly blazing
 in front of it, a hideous flickering hedge sculpture with eyes and a mouth,
 shying away, too late.
  Wincing at the pain, Hallorann drove his blazing arm into its stiff and
 scratchy side.
  In an instant the whole creature was in flames, a prancing, writhing pyre on
 the snow. It bellowed in rage and pain, seeming to chase its flaming tail as it
 zigzagged away from Hallorann.
  He thrust his own arm deep into the snow, killing the flames, unable to take
 his eyes from the hedge lion's death agonies for a moment. Then, gasping, he got
 to his feet. The arm of Durkin's parka was sooty but unburned, and that also
 described his hand. Thirty yards downhill from where he stood, the hedge lion
 had turned into a fireball. Sparks flew at the sky and were viciously snatched
 away by the wind. For a moment its ribs and skull were etched in orange flame
 and then it seemed to collapse, disintegrate, and fall into separate burning
 piles.
  (Never mind it. Get moving.)
  He picked up the gascan and struggled over to the snowmobile. His
 consciousness seemed to be flickering in and out, offering him cuttings and
 snippets of home movies but never the whole picture. In one of these he was
 aware of yanking the snowmobile back onto its tread and then sitting on it, out
 of breath and incapable of moving for a few moments. In another, he was
 reattaching the gascan, which was still half-full. His bead was thumping
 horribly from the gasfumes (and in reaction to his battle with the hedge lion,
 he supposed), and he saw by the steaming hole in the snow beside him that he had
 vomited, but he was unable to remember when.
  The snowmobile, the engine still warm, fired immediately. He twisted the
 throttle unevenly and started forward with a series of neck-snapping jerks that
 made his head ache even more fiercely. At first the snowmobile wove drunkenly
 from side to side, but by half-standing to get his face above the windscreen and
 into the sharp, needling blast of the wind, he drove some of the stupor out of
 himself. He opened the throttle wider.
  (Where are the rest of the hedge animals?)
  He didn't know, but at least he wouldn't be caught unaware again.
  The Overlook loomed in front of him, the lighted first-floor windows throwing
 long yellow rectangles onto the snow. The gate at the foot of the drive was
 locked and he dismounted after a wary look around, praying he hadn't lost his
 keys when he pulled his lighter out of his pocket . . . no, they were there. He
 picked through them in the bright light thrown by the snowmobile headlamp. He
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (316 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 found the right one and unsnapped the padlock, letting it drop into the snow. At
 first he didn't think he was going to be able to move the gate anyway; he pawed
 frantically at the snow surrounding it, disregarding the throbbing agony in his
 head and the fear that one of the other lions might be creeping up behind him.
 He managed to pull it a foot and a half away from the gatepost, squeezed into
 the gap, and pushed. He got it to move another two feet, enough room for the
 snowmobile, and threaded it through.
  He became aware of movement ahead of him in the dark. The hedge animals, all
 of them, were clustered at the base of the Overlook's steps, guarding the way
 in, the way out. The lions prowled. The dog stood with its front paws on the
 first step.
  Hallorann opened the throttle wide and the snowmobile leaped forward, puffing
 snow up behind it. In the caretaker's apartment, Jack Torrance's head jerked
 around at the high, wasplike buzz of the approaching engine, and suddenly began
 to move laboriously toward the hallway again. The bitch wasn't important now.
 The bitch could wait. Now it was this dirty nigger's turn. This dirty,
 interfering nigger with his nose in where it didn't belong. First him and then
 his son. He would show them. He would show them that . . . that he . . . that he
 was of managerial timber!
  Outside, the snowmobile rocketed along faster and faster. The hotel seemed to
 surge toward it. Snow flew in Hallorann's face. The headlamp's oncoming glare
 spotlighted the hedge shepherd's face, its blank and socketless eyes.
  Then it shrank away, leaving an opening. Hallorann yanked at the snowmobile's
 steering gear with all his remaining strength, and it kicked around in a sharp
 semicircle, throwing up clouds of snow, threatening to tip over. The rear end
 struck the foot of the porch steps and rebounded. Hallorann was off in a flash
 and running up the steps. He stumbled, fell, picked himself up. The dog was
 growling--again in his head--close behind him. Something ripped at the shoulder
 of the parka and then he was on the porch, standing in the narrow corridor Jack
 had shoveled through the snow, and safe. They were too big to fit in here.
  He reached the big double doors which gave on the lobby and dug for his keys
 again. While he was getting them he tried the knob and it turned freely. He
 pushed his way in.
  
 he cried hoarsely. 

  Silence came back.
  His eyes traveled across the lobby to the foot of the wide stairs and a harsh
 gasp escaped him. The rug was splashed and matted with blood. There was a scrap
 of pink terrycloth robe. The trail of blood led up the stairs. The banister was
 also splashed with it.
  
 he muttered, and raised his voice again.
  

  The hotel's silence seemed to mock him with echoes which were almost there,
 sly and oblique.

  (Danny? Who's Danny? Anybody here know a Danny? Danny, Danny, who's got the
 Danny? Anybody for a game of spin the Danny? Pin the tail on the Danny? Get out
 of here, black boy. No one here knows Danny from Adam.)
  Jesus, had he come through everything just to be too late? Had it been done?
  He ran up the stairs two at a time and stood at the top of the first floor.
 The blood led down toward the caretaker's apartment. Horror crept softly into
 his veins and into his brain as he began to walk toward the short hall. The
 hedge animals had been bad, but this was worse. In his heart he was already sure
 of what he was going to find when he got down there.
  He was in no hurry to see it.
  Jack had been hiding in the elevator when Hallorann came up the stairs. Now he
 crept up behind the figure in the snowcoated parka, a blood- and gore-streaked
 phantom with a smile upon its face. The roque mallet was lifted as high as the
 ugly, ripping pain in his back
  (?? did the bitch stick me can't remember ??)
  would allow.
  
 he whispered. 
ll teach you to go sticking your nose in other
 people

  Hallorann heard the whisper and began to turn, to duck, and the roque mallet
 whistled down. The hood of the parka matted the blow, but not enough. A rocket
 exploded in his head, leaving a contrail of stars . . . and then nothing.
  He staggered against the silk wallpaper and Jack hit him again, the roque
 mallet slicing sideways this time, shattering Hallorann's cheekbone and most of
 the teeth on the left side of his jaw. He went down limply.
  
 Jack whispered. 
 Where was Danny? He had business with
 his trespassing son.
  Three minutes later the elevator door banged open on the shadowed third floor.
 Jack Torrance was in it alone. The car had stopped only halfway into the doorway
 and he had to boost himself up onto the hall floor, wriggling painfully like a
 crippled thing. He dragged the splintered roque mallet after him. Outside the
 eaves, the wind howled and roared. Jack's eyes rolled wildly in their sockets.
 There was blood and confetti in his hair.
  His son was up here, up here somewhere. He could feel it. Left to his own
 devices, he might do anything: scribble on the expensive silk wallpaper with his
 crayons, deface the furnishings, break the windows. He was a liar and a cheat
 and he would have to be chastised . . . harshly.
  Jack Torrance struggled to his feet.
  
 he called.

                                     TONY
  (Danny . . .)
  (Dannneee . . .)
  Darkness and hallways. He was wandering through darkness and hallways that
 were like those which lay within the body of the hotel but were somehow
 different. The silkpapered walls stretched up and up, and even when he craned
 his neck, Danny could not see the ceiling. It was lost in dimness. All the doors
 were locked, and they also rose up to dimness. Below the peepholes (in these
 giant doors they were the size of gunsights), tiny skulls and crossbones had
 been bolted to each door instead of room numbers.
  And somewhere, Tony was calling him.
  (Dannneee . . .)
  There was a pounding noise, one be knew well, and hoarse shouts, faint with
 distance. He could not make out word for word, but he knew the text well enough
 by now. He had heard it before, in dreams and awake.
  He paused, a little boy not yet three years out of diapers, and tried to
 decide where he was, where he might be. There was fear, but it was a fear he
 could live with. He had been afraid every day for two months now, to a degree
 that ranged from dull disquiet to outright, mind-bending terror. This he could
 live with. But he wanted to know why Tony had come, why he was making the sound
 of his name in this hall that was neither a part of real things nor of the
 dreamland where Tony sometimes showed him things. Why, where-
  "Danny."
  Far down the giant hallway, almost as tiny as Danny himself, was a dark
 figure. Tony.
  "Where am I?" he called softly to Tony.
  "Sleeping," Tony said. "Sleeping in your mommy and daddy
 There was
 sadness in Tony's voice.
  
 Tony said. 

  

  He cried it out in a distant grief, a terror that seemed damped by these
 dreamy, dreary surroundings. Nonetheless, death images came to him: dead frog
 plastered to the turnpike like a grisly stamp; Daddy's broken watch lying on top
 of a box of junk to be thrown out; gravestones with a dead person under every
 one; dead jay by the telephone pole; the cold junk Mommy scraped off the plates
 and down the dark maw of the garbage disposal.

file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
  Yet he could not equate these simple symbols with the shifting complex reality
 of his mother; she satisfied his childish definition of eternity. She had been
 when he was not. She would continue to be when he was not again. He could accept
 the possibility of his own death, he had dealt with that since the encounter in
 Room 217.
  But not hers.
  Not Daddy's.
  Not ever.
  He began to struggle, and the darkness and the hallway began to waver. Tony's
 form became chimerical, indistinct.

  "She

  "Then you have to help her. Danny . . . you

  "You

  "I didn

 first time, Tony began to walk closer. "You
re alone here for a little while, Danny. This is
 an Overlook where no one can ever come. No clocks work here. None of the keys
 fit them and they can never be wound up. The doors have never been opened and no
 one has ever stayed in the rooms. But you can
s coming."
  "It . . ." Danny whispered fearfully, and as he did so the irregular pounding
 noise seemed to grow closer, louder. His terror, cool and distant a moment ago,
 became a more immediate thing. Now the words could be made out. Hoarse,
 huckstering; they were uttered in a coarse imitation of his father
t Daddy. He knew that now. He knew
  (You brought yourself. Because you knew.)
  "Oh Tony, is it my daddy?" Danny screamed. "Is it my daddy that

  Tony didn't answer. But Danny didn't need an answer. He knew. A long and
 nightmarish masquerade party went on here, and had gone on for years. Little by
 little a force bad accrued, as secret and silent as interest in a bank account.
 Force, presence, shape, they were all only words and none of them mattered. It
 wore many masks, but it was all one. Now, somewhere, it was coming for him. It
 was hiding behind Daddy's face, it was imitating Daddy's voice, it was wearing
 Daddy's clothes.
  But it was not his daddy.
  It was not his daddy.

  And now Tony stood directly in front of him, and looking at Tony was like
 looking into a magic mirror and seeing himself in ten years, the eyes widely

 light blond like his mother

  But below him, the faint sound of the mallet against the walls went on and on,
 drifting up through the elevator shaft and the stairwell. The controlling force

 of the Overlook, in the shape of his father, blundering around on the first
 floor.
  A door opened with a thin screeing sound behind him.
  A decayed woman in a rotten silk gown pranced out, her yellowed and splitting
 fingers dressed with verdigris-caked rings. Heavy-bodied wasps crawled
 sluggishly over her face.
  "Come in," she whispered to him, grinning with black lips. "Come in and we
 will daance the taaaango . . ."
  "False face!" he hissed. "Not real!" She drew back from him in alarm, and in
 the act of drawing back she faded and was gone.
  "Where are you?" it screamed, but the voice was still only in his head. He
 could still hear the thing that was wearing Jack

  What was it? He almost knew. Something that might save him and Mommy? But Tony
 had said he would have to do it himself. What was it?
  He sank down against the wall, trying desperately to think. It was so hard . .
 . the hotel kept trying to get into his head . . . the image of that dark and
 slumped form swinging the mallet from side to side, gouging the wallpaper . . .
 sending out puffs of plaster dust.
  "Help me," he muttered. "Tony, help me."
  And suddenly he became aware that the hotel had grown deathly silent. The
 whining sound of the motor had stopped
  (must not have been real)
  and the sounds of the party had stopped and there was only the wind, howling
 and whooping endlessly.
  The elevator whirred into sudden life.
  It was coming up.
  And Danny knew who--what--was in it.
  He bolted to his feet, eyes staring wildly. Panic clutched around his heart.
 Why had Tony sent him to the third floor? He was trapped up here. All the doors
 were locked.

  Her blond hair, now dank and matted, hung in her eyes. She brushed it away and
 her ribs stabbed inside, making her groan. Now she saw a field of blue and white
 mattress, spotted with blood. Her blood, or maybe Jack
t been out long. And that was important because-
  (?Why?)
  Because-
  It was the insectile, buzzing sound of the motor that she remembered first.
 For a moment she fixed stupidly on the memory, and then in a single vertiginous
 and nauseating swoop, her mind seemed to pan back, showing her everything at
 once.
  Hallorann. It must have been Hallorann. Why else would Jack have left so
 suddenly, without finishing it . . , without finishing her?
  Because he was no longer at leisure. He had to find Danny quickly and . . .
 and do it before Hallorann could put a stop to it.
  Or had it happened already?
  She could hear the whine of the elevator rising up the shaft.
  (No God please no the blood the blood
t let it have happened
 already)
  Somehow she was able to find her feet and stagger through the bedroom and
 across the ruins of the living room to the shattered front door. She pushed it
 open and made it out into the hall.
  "Danny!" she cried, wincing at the pain in her chest. "Mr. Hallorann! Is
 anybody there? Anybody?"
  The elevator had been running again and now it came to a stop. She heard the
 metallic crash of the gate being thrown back and then thought she heard a
 speaking voice. It might have been her imagination. The wind was too loud to
 really be able to tell.
  Leaning against the wall, she made her way up to the corner of the short
 hallway. She was about to turn the corner when the scream froze her, floating
 down the stairwell and the elevator shaft:
  "Danny! Come here, you pup! Come here aced take it like a man!"
  Jack. On the second or third floor. Looking for Danny.
  She got around the corner, stumbled, almost fell. Her breath caught in her

  huddled against the wall about a quarter of the way down from the stairwell.
 She began to hurry faster, wincing every time her weight came down on her hurt
 leg. It was a man, she saw, and as she drew closer, she understood the meaning
 of that buzzing motor.
  It was Mr. Hallorann. He had come after all.
  She eased to her knees beside him, offering up an incoherent prayer that he
 was not dead. His nose was bleeding, and a terrible gout of blood had spilled
 out of his mouth. The side of his face was a puffed purple bruise. But he was
 breathing, thank God for that. It was coming in long, harsh draws that shook his
 whole frame.

  "Danny!" the hoarse, petulant voice roared from above them. "Get out here,

  There was no time to wonder about it now. She began to shake him, her face
 twisting at the flare of agony in her ribs. Her side felt hot and massive and
 swollen.

 The words came in a thin shriek. The mallet wavered wildly in

  The face in front of him changed. It was hard to say how; there was no melting
 or merging of the features. The body trembled slightly, and then the bloody
 hands opened like broken claws. The mallet fell from them and thumped to the
 rug. That was all. But suddenly his daddy was there, looking at him in mortal
 agony, and a sorrow so great that Danny

 himself up. He and Wendy stared at each other like nightmare survivors from a
 bombed hospital.

 Wendy said. "Now he can only help himself."
  A minute passed, then two. Three. And they heard it above them, screaming, not

  "Has it killed him?"

  The elevator clashed into life and began to descend with the screaming, raving
 thing penned up inside.
                                     * * *
  Danny stood without moving. There was no place he could run where the Overlook
 was not. He recognized it suddenly, fully, painlessly. For the first time in his
 life he had an adult thought, an adult feeling, the essence of his experience in
 this bad place--a sorrowful distillation:
  (Mommy and Daddy can't help me and I'm alone.)
  
 he said to the bloody stranger in front of him. 

  It bent over, exposing the knife handle in its back. Its hands closed around
 the mallet again, but instead of aiming at Danny, it reversed the handle, aiming
 the hard side of the roque mallet at its own face.
  Understanding rushed through Danny.
  Then the mallet began to rise and descend, destroying the last of Jack
 Torrance's image. The thing in the hall danced an eerie, shuffling polka, the
 beat counterpointed by the hideous sound of the mallet head striking again and
 again. Blood splattered across the wallpaper. Shards of bone leaped into the air
 like broken piano keys. It was impossible to say just how long it went on. But
 when it turned its attention back to Danny, his father was gone forever. What
 remained of the face became a strange, shifting composite, many faces mixed
 imperfectly into one. Danny saw the woman in 217; the dogman; the hungry boy
thing that had been in the concrete ring.
  
 it whispered. 

  The mallet rose for the final time. A ticking sound filled Danny's ears.
  
 it inquired.

 game of tag, perhaps? All we have is time, you know. An eternity of time. Or
 shall we end it? Might as well. After all, we

  And it came to him. What his father had forgotten.
  Sudden triumph filled his face; the thing saw it and hesitated, puzzled.
  
 Danny screamed.

  An expression of grotesque terror and dawning realization swept across the
 broken features of the thing in front of him. The mallet dropped from its fisted
 hands and bounced harmlessly on the black and blue rug.
  "The boiler!" it cried. "Oh no! That can

 fists at the ruined thing before him.

  It suddenly turned tail and began to shamble away. For a moment its shadow
 bobbed on the wall, waxing and waning. It trailed cries behind itself like
 wornout party streamers.
  Moments later the elevator crashed into life.
  Suddenly the shining was on him
  (mommy mr. hallorann dick to my friends together alive they're alive got to
 get out it's going to blow going to blow sky-high)
  like a fierce and glaring sunrise and he ran. One foot kicked the bloody,
 misshapen roque mallet aside. He didn't notice.
  Crying, he ran for the stairs.
  They bad to get out.
                                   << 57 >>
                                 THE EXPLOSION
  Hallorann could never be sure of the progression of things after that. He
 remembered that the elevator had gone down and past them without stopping, and
 something had been inside. But he made no attempt to try to see in through the
 small diamond-shaped window, because what was in there did not sound human. A
 moment later there were running footsteps on the stairs. Wendy Torrance at first
 shrank back against him and then began to stumble down the main corridor to the
 stairs as fast as she could.
  

  She swept him into a hug, groaning with joy as well as her pain.
  (Danny.)
  Danny looked at him from his mother's arms, and Hallorann saw how the boy had
 changed. His face was pale and pinched, his eyes dark and fathomless. He looked
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (329 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 as if he had lost weight. Looking at the two of them together, Hallorann thought
 it was the mother who looked younger, in spite of the terrible beating she had
 taken.
  (Dick--we have to go--run--the place--it's going to)
  Picture of the Overlook, flames leaping out of its roof. Bricks raining down
 on the snow. Clang of firebells . . . not that any fire truck would be able to
 get up here much before the end of March. Most of all what came through in
 Danny's thought was a sense of urgent immediacy, a feeling that it was going to
 happen at any time.
  
 Hallorann said. He began to move toward the two of them and at
 first it was like swimming through deep water. His sense of balance was screwed,
 and the eye on the right side of his face didn't want to focus. His jaw was
 sending giant throbbing bursts of pain up to his temple and down his neck, and
 his cheek felt as large as a cabbage. But the boy's urgency had gotten him
 going, and it got a little easier.
  
 Wendy asked. She looked from Hallorann to her son and back to
 Hallorann. 

  
 Hallorann said.

  Hallorann burst out through the double doors and carried the two of them
 through the trench in the big snowdrift on the porch. He saw the hedge animals
 clearly, more clearly than before, and even as he realized his worst fears were
 true, that they were between the porch and the snowmobile, the hotel exploded.
 It seemed to him that it happened all at once, although later he knew that

 hold on them and then he struck the snow in a soft billow. It was down his shirt
 and up his nose and he was dimly aware that it felt good on his hurt cheek.
  Then he struggled to the top of it, for that moment not thinking about the
 hedge animals, or Wendy Torrance, or even the boy. He rolled over on his back so
 he could watch it die.

  "Missus Torrance! Hold onto me! You understand? Hold on!"
  She put her arms around him and rested her cheek against his back. Hallorann
 started the snowmobile and turned the throttle delicately so they would start up
 without a jerk. The woman had the weakest sort of grip on him, and if she
 shifted backward, her weight would tumble both her and the boy off.
  They began to move. He brought the snowmobile around in a circle and then they
 were traveling west parallel to the hotel. Hallorann cut in more to circle
 around behind it to the equipment shed.
  They had a momentarily clear view into the Overlook

  "Come back as quick as you can," Danny whispered. "Please."
  Hallorann nodded. He had trained the headlamp on the door and now he

 pushed the equipment shed door open and stepped in. The horseblankets were still
 in the corner, by the rogue set. He picked up four of themthey smelled musty and
 old and the moths certainly had been having a free lunch--and then he paused.
  One of the rogue mallets was gone.

t fall off.
  "Now hold on for dear life," he said. "We got a long way to go, but the worst
 is behind us now."
  He circled the equipment shed and then pointed the snowmobile back along their
 trail. The Overlook was a torch now, flaming at the sky. Great holes had been
 eaten into its sides, and there was a red hell inside, waxing and waning.
 Snowmelt ran down the charred gutters in steaming waterfalls.
  They purred down the front lawns their way well lit. The snowdunes glowed
 scarlet.
  "Look!" Danny shouted as Hallorann slowed for the front gate. He was pointing
 toward the playground.
  The hedge creatures were all in their original positions, but they were
 denuded, blackened, seared. Their dead branches were a stark interlacing network
 in the fireglow, their small leaves scattered around their feet like fallen
 petals.
  "They

  Hallorann edged through the gap between gate and post. A moment later they
 were on the road, pointed back toward Sidewinder. The sound of the snowmobile's
 engine dwindled until it was lost in the ceaseless roar of the wind. It rattled
 through the denuded branches of the hedge animals with a low, beating, desolate
 sound. The fire waxed and waned. Sometime after the sound of the snowmobile's
 engine had disappeared, the Overlooks roof caved in-first the west wing, then
 the east, and seconds later the central roof. A huge spiraling gout of sparks
 and flaming debris rushed up into the howling winter night.
  A bundle of flaming shingles and a wad of hot flashing were wafted is through
 the open equipment shed door by the wind.
  After a while the shed began to burn, too.

  They were still twenty miles from Sidewinder when Hallorann stopped to pour
 the rest of the gas into the snowmobile's tank. He was getting very worried
 about Wendy Torrance, who seemed to be drifting away from them. It was still so
 far to go.
  
 Danny cried. He was standing up on the seat, pointing. 

  The snow had stopped and a silver-dollar moon had peeked out through the
 raftering clouds. Far down the road but coming toward them, coming upward
 through a series of S-shaped switchbacks, was a pearly chain of lights. The wind
 dropped for a moment and Hallorann heard the faraway buzzing snarl of snowmobile
 engines.
  Hallorann and Danny and Wendy reached them fifteen minutes later. They had
 brought extra clothes and brandy and Dr. Edmunds.
  And the long darkness was over.
                                   << 58 >>
                                EPILOGUE/SUMMER
  After he had finished checking over the salads his understudy had made and
 peeked in on the home-baked beans they were using as appetizers this week,
 Hallorann untied his apron, hung it on a hook, and slipped out the back door. He
 had maybe forty-five minutes before he had to crank up for dinner in earnest.
  The name of this place was the Red Arrow Lodge, and it was buried in the
 western Maine mountains, thirty miles from the town of Rangely. It was a good
 gig, Hallorann thought. The trade wasn't too heavy, it tipped well, and so far
 there hadn't been a single meal sent back. Not bad at all, considering the
 season was nearly half over.
  He threaded his way between the outdoor bar and the swimming pool (although
 why anyone would want to use the pool with the lake so handy he would never
 know), crossed a greensward where a party of four was playing croquet and
 laughing, and crested a mild ridge. Pines took over here, and the wind soughed
 pleasantly in them, carrying the aroma of fir and sweet resin.
  On the other side, a number of cabins with views of the lake were placed
 discreetly among the trees. The last one was the nicest, and Hallorann had
 reserved it for a party of two back in April when he had gotten this gig.
  The woman was sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, a book in her hands.
 file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Ste...g%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt (338 of 342)7/28/2005 9:09:54 PM
file:///E|/Funny%20&%20Weird%20Shit/75%20-%20Stephen%20King%20Books/Stephen%20King%20-%20The%20Shining.txt
 Hallorann was struck again by the change in her. Part of it was the stiff,
 almost formal way she sat, in spite of her informal surroundings-that was the
 back brace, of course. She'd had a shattered vertebra as well as three broken
 ribs and some internal injuries. The back was the slowest healing, and she was
 still in the brace . . . hence the formal posture. But the change was more than
 that. She looked older, and some of the laughter had gone out of her face. Now,
 as she sat reading her book, Hallorann saw a grave sort of beauty there that had
 been missing on the day he had first met her, some nine months ago. Then she had
 still been mostly girl. Now she was a woman, a human being who had been dragged
 around to the dark side of the moon and had come back able to put the pieces
 back together. But those pieces, Hallorann thought, they never fit just the same
 way again. Never in this world.
  She heard his step and looked up, closing her book. 
 She started to
 rise, and a little grimace of pain crossed her face.

  She smiled as he came up the steps and sat down next to her on the porch.

  "That

  "Right down there." She pointed, and Hallorann saw a small figure sitting at
 the end of the dock. He was wearing jeans rolled up to the knee and a red
striped shirt. Further out on the calm water, a bobber floated. Every now and
 then Danny would reel it in, examine the sinker and hook below it, and then toss
 it out again.

 little, Hallorann with his feet up on the porch rail, smoking. A little breeze
 came up, pushing its secret way through the pines but barely ruffling Wendy
I've decided to take Al--Mr. Shockley--up on his offer,
It sounds like a good job. Something you could get
 interested in. When do you start?
Right after Labor Day. When Danny and I leave here, we'll be going right on
 to Maryland to look for a place. It was really the Chamber of Commerce brochure
 that convinced me, you know. It looks like a nice town to raise a kid in. And
 I'd like to be working again before we dig too deeply into the insurance money
 Jack left. There's still over forty thousand dollars. Enough to send Danny to
 college with enough left over to get him a start, if it's invested right.

  He walked down the sloping, graveled path that led to the dock and then out
 along the weather-beaten boards to the end, where Danny sat with his feet in the
 clear water. Beyond, the lake widened out, mirroring the pines along its verge.
 The terrain was mountainous around here, but the mountains were old, rounded and
 humbled by time. Hallorann liked them just fine.
  
 Hallorann said, sitting down next to him. He took off one
 shoe, then the other. With a sigh, he let his hot feet down into the cool water.
