You
I
I know,
It
First of all, we want to make sure
 you
Whatever you need.
Okay, great, thank you,
Um, okay. I want to get the
 annoying stuff out of the way first. The crap stuff. If your wife was indeed
 abducted – and we don

 wife was—
Nonono, Nick,
It
We try to cover every base:
 Check your hands, get a swab, and if we could check out your car too …
Of course. Like I said, whatever you need.
Thank you, Nick. I really appreciate it. Sometimes guys, they make
 things hard for us just because they can.
You
I
Yes, definitely, fire away.
You
 mind? This way you won
So: Amy,
You two been living here how long?
Just about two years.
And she
Yes.
She work, got a job?
No. She used to write personality quizzes.

 the jealous type? Take our quiz and find out! Do guys find you too
 intimidating? Take our quiz and find out!”
Very cool, I love those,

 about noon, and in between, you were at the beach.
I sometimes bring my coffee and the paper and just sit. Gotta make the
 most of summer.
It
I know
 we are having a tough time. I still love you so much, Nick, and I know I have
 a lot of things to work on. I want to be a good wife to you, and I want you to
 be my husband and be happy. But you need to decide what you want.
Can you tell me what your
 wife
Uh, no, I don
You don
Maybe O?
Okay, Nick,
 here are the things we are doing to help.
I can
I mean, my wife is gone. My wife: is
 gone!
Nick, we are taking this extremely seriously,
The lab guys
 are over at your place as we speak, and that will give us more information to
 go on. Right now, the more you can tell us about your wife, the better. What
 is she like?
What is she like how?
Give me an idea of her personality,
Like, what did
 you get her for your anniversary? Jewelry?

 afternoon.

We are the definition of not close.

Ohhh, that
Baby!
What did you do tonight?
Some guys were playing poker after work, so I hung around for a bit.
 Hope that was okay.
Of course,
More fun than my night.
Who all showed up?
Oh, Campbell and Insley and their dancing monkeys. Boring. You
 dodged a bullet. A really lame bullet.
God, I love you,
I hate them all, just by name,
Nick,
 you know the story of my name.
I
Thanks, man, thank you,
Man, my wife, she
Absolutely hysterical.
I
I gotta—
Just sitting around, crying over pictures of Amy.
Hey, I gotta ask—
Could I look inside?
No, I
Has somebody
 looked inside?
If it
Sir, I can
This is ridiculous. It
Sir, this is a crime scene, you—
Your in-laws
 are here, Nick
Your father and I have decided it would be best
 for everyone if we live apart,
Good, I hate
 you both!
Thank God the old Maureen is back,
How is Amy?,
She
Nick,
How are you holding up?
We
It
How are you, Nick?
Ahh!
 Iconoclast. Disdains the easy, symbolic patriotism.
Because of the divorce. All those comfort foods, the
 desserts a family eats together, those are just bad memories for Nick.
… and
 the main point of this, Nick, is just to get people looking for Amy and
 knowing she has a family who loves her and wants her back. This will be
 very controlled. Nick, you will need to – Nick?
Yep.
People will want to hear a quick statement from her husband.
Okay so far?
I wish Mom was here,
No news?
Nothing, fucking nothing—
You look like you feel awful.
I feel like fucking shit.
I would have finished the bottle, too.
It
It
We just want
 Amy to get home safe …
Our daughter, Amy, is a
 sweetheart of a girl, full of life. She
We all want her back where she belongs, with her
 family. We
Heard you had
 some emergency drinking to do on your anniversary, Nicky.
Happy day after anniversary,
Amy, I
I was just saying happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary, my asshole husband who neglected me on my big
 day.
Well, how was it?
How was it? It was fucking awful. Sixteen of my friends now have no
 jobs. It was miserable. I
I know it feels dire right now, Nick. But—
It
such a nice face.
But of course, Ellen has to work,
Nick, I
Not according to the prenup.
That
It
You
You just don
I
You
Fuck you, Amy.
I
Canna grab a minute, Nick?
We checked out that
 house in your neighborhood that was broken into, looks like people camped
 out there, so we
I mean, that
Guys are camped out
 everywhere. This whole town is overrun with pissed-off, unemployed
 people.
Go ahead,
We wanted you to take a look at this.
Imagine our confusion: A missing persons case, and
 here we find an envelope marked first clue.
It
Right. For your anniversary. Your father-in-law mentioned it.
Oh, I actually know this! She must mean my office. At the junior
 college. I
She took it easy on me this year.
You want me to drive you over?
Nah, I
I
You think it
Well, it shows her movements the day or two before she went missing.
 So it
It
What do you teach?
Journalism, magazine journalism.
I thought you didn
He who can
Your key always on your key chain?
Yup.
So Amy could have borrowed that to get in?
And we have a spare at home.
Why?
Oh, just wanted to make sure she wouldn
No Freddy Krueger types here, that I
Never saw those movies,
Sweet lady,
Um, hah,
 these yours?
Oh, jeez. That
Uh, one time Amy and I, well, you read her note. We kinda, you know,
 you sometimes gotta spice things up a little.
Oh I get it, randy professor and naughty student. I get it.
 You two really were doing it right.
Just a precaution,
Oh, please don
Amy would die—
Don
So what
I have no idea,
We have a cold-cut tray if you want,
 sweetheart,
Perfect photo,
People
 will see it and really know what Amy looks like.
We should get them some candid photos too,
Some everyday
 ones.
I feel sick.
I know,
How are you holding up, Nick?
I
You know, I gotta ask, what about your employees, Nick?
Anyone? Something? Anything?
Want some gin with it too, babe?
Sure. Yes. I do.
I gave them lists of everyone,
But it
Of course, we
Mrs Tibbles, I don
Do you have worries that this might link back to the Amazing Amy
 business?
We do have a few people we thought might be worth checking out,
Do you think Judith Viorst kidnapped Amy for
 Alexander so he wouldn
Bony
 Moronie
I
We
We
And that bitch
 Beverly Cleary too.
I guess I should tell you,
The cops, it
To look at the husband first, I know,
I told them
 they
They were offensive,
So they have spoken with you? About me?
What kind of stuff did they ask?
Have you ever hurt Amy, has Amy ever mentioned you threatening
 her?
Are you a womanizer, has Amy ever mentioned
 you cheating on her? Because that sounds like Amy, right? I told them we
 didn
Nick, what we should have said, first
of all, is: We know you would never, ever hurt Amy. I even told the police,
 told them the story about you saving the mouse at the beach house, saving it
 from the glue trap.
Spent an hour trying to
 corner the damn thing, and then literally drove the little rat bastard out of
 town. Does that sound like a guy who would hurt his wife?
We love you, Nick,
We do, Nick,
You
They did wonder about your restaurant reservations that night,
My reservations?
They said you told them you had reservations at Houston
Uh, no. No, I never made reservations. They must have misunderstood
 me. I
Oh, okay. Good,
Did she, uh, did you get a treasure
 hunt this year?
Before …
Yeah, they gave me the first clue today. Gilpin and I found the second
 one in my office at the college. I
Can we take a look?
I don
Will you … will you try to solve it, Nick?
I will, Marybeth. I
I just hate the idea of things she touched, left out there, all alone—
You should pick up every call, Nick,
I recognized this one – just my college alum fund looking for money.
We do think it
We
Lately?
Not lately, no,
But there was a very
 disturbed girl back in high school.
Disturbed how?
She was obsessed with Amy. Well, with Amazing Amy. Her name was
 Hilary Handy – she modeled herself after Amy
I’m going to be your daughter now.
 I’m going to kill Amy and be your new Amy. Because it doesn’t really matter
 to you, does it? As long as you have an Amy.
We finally got a restraining order because she threw Amy down a flight
of stairs at school,
Very disturbed girl. That kind of mentality
 doesn
And then Desi,
And Desi,
Good luck.
It
Desi lives not far away, actually,
St. Louis.
Now, see?
Why are the cops not all over this?
Someone needs to be,
I
The police definitely seem to think it
Are you sure you
I
How Are You Handling
 Your Layoff?
That
At least you have your money to fall
 back on.
We have the money. I liked my job, though.
You Can
What is all this, Nick?
For job interviews. If anyone ever starts hiring again.
You needed so much?
We do have the money.
Do you at least want to hang them up?
Not really, nope,
Well, do you mind if I hang these up? Just so they stay nice for you?
Knock yourself out.
Kids, your mother and I, we seem to have—
Well, we seem to have gotten ourselves into a hell of a financial mess.
The fact of the matter is, we
We
We
Our house, as well as this house,
 it
Like I said, we made some serious judgment errors,
We should write a book: Amazing Amy and the Adjustable Rate Mortgage.
 We would flunk every quiz. We
Harry Head in the Sand,
So what happens next?
That is entirely up to you,
We wanted to ask if we could borrow some
 money from your trust while we figure out what to do with the rest of our
 lives.
Well, the trust fund is your money, so of course you can borrow from
 it,
How much do you think you need, to pay everything off and
 feel comfortable for a while?
Six
 hundred and fifty thousand,
Oh.
Amy, maybe you and I should discuss—
No, no, we can do this,
I
Actually,
if you could wire it to our account
 tomorrow, that would be best. Otherwise there
Do you guys keep an eye on everyone who reports to volunteer?
I mean, in case it
Someone who seems to have a suspicious amount of interest?
 Absolutely.
But to tell the truth, serial killers watch the
 same TV shows we do. They know that we know they like to—
Insert themselves into the investigation.
That
So they
Like, Gilpin and I were lead detectives on the Kayla Holman case few
 years back. Kayla Holman?
Anyway, you
Because they look like the type. To get a little too
 interested in consoling the worried husband.
Oh, come on—
You
She
So that
How
By the way, Nick,
Remember when I asked if Amy had
 friends in town – what about Noelle Hawthorne? You didn
Noelle in your complex? Mother of triplets?
No, they aren
Oh, funny. She definitely seems to think they are.
That happens to Amy a lot,
She talks to people once, and they
 latch on. It
That
People think they know her because they read the books growing up,
I can see that,
People want to believe they know
 other people. Parents want to believe they know their kids. Wives want to
 believe they know their husbands.
it
He
Plenty of time for babies,
The prodijal son returns,
Stucks,

Come on, man, these little pansy-ass searches? I seen more effort put
 into finding the mayor
Why ain
What are the Blue Book Boys? A gang?
All those guys got laid off from the Blue Book plant last winter. No
 severance, nothing. You see some of the homeless guys wandering around
 town in packs, looking real, real pissed? Probably Blue Book Boys.
I
You know: River Valley Printworks. On edge of town? They made
 those blue books you used for essays and shit in college.
Oh. I didn
Now colleges use computers, whatnot, so – phwet! – bye-bye, Blue
 Book Boys.
God, this whole town is shutting down,
The Blue Book Boys, they drink, drug, harass people. I mean, they did
 that before, but they always had to stop, go back to work on Monday. Now
 they just run wild.
So, the cops been out to the mall?
Shit, man, didn
The
 Blue Book Boys, they all made themselves a nice little town over in the mall.
 Squatting. Drug deals. The police run them out every once in a while, but
 they
Why isn
The mall will be searched, Nick. We have cops heading over there right
 now.
Oh. Okay. Because a buddy of mine—
Stucks, I know, I know him.
He was talking about all the—
The Blue Book Boys, I know. Trust us, Nick, we got this. We want to
 find Amy as much as you do.
Okay, uh, thanks.
concerned
What should I be doing?
I feel like a jackass here.
 I need to do something.
We really need you right here, Nick. Just be friendly, be encouraging,
Offer water.
 Just point anyone who comes in my way.
Hi, Nick, I
I hope you have friends, relatives, who are looking out for you during
 this, Nick,
Men forget to take care of
 themselves. Comfort food is what you need.
We
Oh, you poor man. Well, cold cuts, that won
You need to keep up your strength.
 Now, you are lucky, because I make a mean chicken Frito pie. You know
what? I am going to put that together and drop it by the volunteer center
 tomorrow. You can just microwave it whenever you want a nice warm
 dinner.
Oh, that sounds like too much trouble, really. We
You
I really hope it doesn
I swear, I have filed complaint after complaint.
 One broke into my garden last month. My motion sensor went off, so I
 peeked outside and there he was, kneeling in the dirt, just guzzling tomatoes.
 Gnawing at them like apples, his face and shirt were covered in juice and
 seeds. I tried to scare him off, but he loaded up at least twenty before he ran
 off. They were on the edge anyway, those Blue Book guys. No other skills.
Don
I
What are you, thirty-one, thirty-two?
Try thirty-four.
A baby.
So anyway, the homeless guys, they can be really aggressive, like,
 threatening, toward women,
I mentioned it to Detective
 Boney, but I get the feeling she doesn
Why do you say that?
Women don
Just one of those
things. Did – does Amy have a lot of friends in town?
We ordered a million little fried things and drank cocktails made from ice
 cream.
I think she may have the same problem you do,
It
Hard to make friends, the
 older you get. Is she your age?
Thirty-eight.
Smart man, likes them older women.
Come here,

Frito casserole smile.

Tell me about Desi again, Rand,
Did you ever meet him?
He came to the house a few times.
He
 was a nice-looking kid, very solicitous of Amy – treated her like a princess.
 But I just never liked him. Even when things were good with them – young

I wanted to.
And you did!
You were just the right amount of nervous, it
 was very sweet. Desi wasn

Nick, we

I mean, could it have been because – I know this is hard to hear, Mr
 Elliott – because Amy was under the influence of something?
I mean, maybe she has had contact with less savory elements
in town. There are plenty of other drug dealers. Maybe she got in over her
 head, and that
Besides me.
Besides you – and noon, when you arrived at your bar. If you were out
 and about in this town, driving to the beach, hanging around the dock area,
 someone must have seen you. Even if it was someone just, you know,
 walking his dog. If you can help us, I think that would be really …

No good ones.

From our home, yes.
You were at the volunteer center, weren

Long way to come.
I could say the same to you.
Look, I
Of course?
Of course someone would … want her,
You know, she always had that way. Of making people want
 her. Always. You know that old cliche´: Men want her, and women want to
 be her. With Amy, that was true.
You had a very intense relationship with Amy, right?
It wasn

See, when Amy likes you, when
 she
Bear with me,
You feel good about yourself. Completely
 good, for maybe the first time. And then she sees your flaws, she realizes

I actually came here, Desi, to see what you could tell me.

You stalked her in high school.
I stalked her? Nick. She was my girlfriend.

Amy shared them with you?

No,
She threw them away unopened, always.
All of them? Always? You know that?
Once I went through the trash to read one.
Just to see what exactly was going on.
Good for you,
I
Amy and I always wrote each other letters,
It was our thing. I find e-mail so … cheap.
And no one saves them. No one saves an e-mail, because it
Have you kept all my letters?
Of course.
Just curious.
It seems to me a rather strange devotion to
 keep up all these years,
I mean, she didn
Oh
It strikes me as odd, Nick, that you
Are you and Amy not close? I can guarantee you: Desi has had no genuine
 contact with Amy in decades. Decades.
I
How very intrepid of you, Nick. Very do-it-yourself. Do you build your
 own decks too?
It was interesting to meet you, Nick,
Let
Call our lawyer,
 please.
My two favorite things to look at in the world,
I always wanted to bring a girl here, a
 perfect girl, and look at me now,
Hi, Nick. We need to
 touch base today, update you on a few things, go over a few questions. Meet
 us at four at your house, okay? Uh … thanks.
Okay, couple of things here,
Some stuff to get clear on, some stuff to tell you. All very routine. And as
 always, if you want a lawyer—
I don
I actually have some information to share with
 you. About Amy
Desi – uh, Collins,
Collings. I know you all talked to him, I know you for some reason
 aren
He was living in St. Louis three years before you all moved back,
Fine, but he
Desi
Don
I
Anyway,
Both he and his mother deny that he ever
 stalked Amy, or that he even had much contact with her these past years
 except the occasional note.
My wife would tell you differently. He wrote Amy for years – years 
and then he shows up here for the search, Rhonda. Did you know that? He
 was here that first day. You talked about keeping an eye out for men inserting
 themselves into the investigation—
Desi Collings is not a suspect,
But—
Desi Collins is not a suspect,
Okay, well what about all these, these guys who
Inserting
 themselves into the investigation: David Samson, Murphy Clark – those are
 old boyfriends – Tommy O
Have you phoned any of them back?

Maybe we should get started on our questions,
Right. Well, I guess we should begin with where you were the morning
 your wife went missing,
When I was at the beach.
And you still can
It
Believe me, I
It
I mean, do I go to the beach and lay out all day? No. But to
 sip my coffee in the morning? Sure.
Hey, this might help,
Where
Could tighten the time frame at least, right?
I made it here,
Oh.
That
I had a leftover cup in the fridge I heated up.
Huh. Must have been there a long time – I noticed there
Few days. Still tastes good.
See, here
We
Dozens upon dozens upon dozens,
Many home invasions. This – all this area right there, in the living room– remember it? The upturned ottoman, the overturned table, the vase on the
 floor
this whole
 area, it was supposed to look like a struggle, right?
Supposed
 to?
It looked wrong,
From the second we saw it. To be
 honest, the whole thing looked staged. First of all, there
And look here,
 at this pile of books. They should be in front of the end table – the end table
 is where they were stacked, right?
So when the end table was knocked over, they should have spilled
 mostly in front of it, following the trajectory of the falling table. Instead,
 they
And watch this. This is very curious to me,
But somehow they
 stayed upright through everything else.
I don
It
So do we, Nick, so do we,
But here
See, this thing
 is bottom-heavy because of those tiny legs. The cushion practically sits on the
 floor. Try to push it over.
Go on, try it,
Seriously, get down there if you need to, and knock that thing upside
 down,
Weird, huh?
Nick, you do any housecleaning the day your wife went missing?
No.
Okay, because the tech did a Luminol sweep, and I
Amy
And I
Oh my God.
But
 —
Yes, so your wife made it out of this room,
Somehow, in
 theory, she made it into the kitchen – without disturbing any of those
 gewgaws on that table just outside the kitchen – and then she collapsed in the
 kitchen, where she lost a lot of blood.
And then someone carefully mopped it up,
Wait. Wait. Why would someone try to hide blood but then mess up the
 living room—
We
I don
Let
You eat anything yet? Want a sandwich, something?
How
I mean, five years, that
The marriage was fine,

You think she might have run off?

 look like a crime scene and took off? Runaway-wife thing?
She hasn

I mean, again, I don
Yes. She does.
It seems extremely unlikely,
If she were to wound herself
 that seriously, why would she mop it up?
So really, let
How was
 your marriage currently? We

Nothing specific, just disagreements. I mean, Amy is a blowstack. She
 bottles up a bunch of little stuff and – whoom! – but then it
Not Wednesday night?
Never,
Is it money, what you mostly argue about?
I can
What stuff was it the night she went missing?
Like I told you, there was the lobster.
What else? I
Other household stuff, too. Married-couple stuff. The cat box,
Who would clean the cat box.
You were in a screaming argument about a cat box,
You know, the principle of the thing. I work a lot of hours, and Amy
 doesn
You
I
 don’t know how to iron, I don’t know how to do the dishes. I can’t cook. So,
 sweetheart, I’ll catch the bad guys, that I can do, and you throw some clothes
 in the washer now and then.
I catch bad guys too, idiot.
So you just wanted a housewife,
I wanted – I wanted whatever Amy wanted. I really didn
Amy
 couldn
And, I mean, it
Like the cat box,
Yeah, clean the cat box, get some groceries, call a plumber to fix the
 drip that drove her crazy.
Wow, that sounds like a real happiness plan there. Lotta yuks.
But my point was, do something. Whatever it is, do something. Make
 the most of the situation. Don
So the move back to Missouri?
You moved Amy here
 against her wishes?
Against her wishes? No. We did what we had to do. I had no job, Amy
 had no job, my mom was sick. I

And you
We
When we first
 married, Amy was wealthy, like extremely wealthy.
Right,
those Amazing Amy books.
Yeah, they made a ton of money in the eighties and nineties. But the
 publisher dropped them. Said Amy had run her course. And everything went
 south. Amy
From your wife, you mean?
Right, fine. And then we used most of the last of Amy

You seem angry about that.
No, like I told you, she seems a little too broken up, like in a fake way.

This is Marybeth Elliott. Please leave a message, and I will return promptly

Hi, Marybeth, it

beloved Nicky grin,
Oh,
Are we okay?
We
Nick. I
I woke up and felt
 totally insane. And awful. I lost my head. It was a momentary freakout. I
 really, truly apologize.
You got to give me this, Nick: exhaustion and stress and … I
Okay,
But I
She was definitely pregnant.
I
The fact of the matter is
 —
I can
Okay.
I
I have an appointment with Tanner
 Bolt.
Thank God. You were able to see him that quick?
That

You
His name can

Really?
No.
Nick Dunne, I
My retainer, Mr Dunne, is a hundred thousand dollars. That
I win, Mr Dunne. I win unwinnable cases, and the case that I think you
 may soon face is – I don
There will be no more police interviews without my presence,

How are things with Amy

Is. She is pregnant. Never, ever
 mention your wife in the past tense.
Fuck.
Don
But everywhere else, worry. Worry hard. From now on, I
 don
I
Okay, we have to
 assume this is bad news for us. But you need to track them down. Nowhere
 public, where some asshole with a cameraphone can film you – we can
Okay.
I need you to make a list for me, Nick. Of all the nice things you
What if I
Come up with
 something, okay, Nick? You seem like a good guy. I
Also, I need a list of people who may have harmed Amy, who may
 have had something against her.
I should tell you, it seems Amy tried to buy a gun earlier this year.
The cops know?
Yes.
Did you know?
Not until the guy she tried to buy from told me.
Then I bet their theory is she
 wanted a gun to protect herself from you,
She was isolated, she was
 scared. She wanted to believe in you, yet she could feel something was very
 wrong, so she wanted a gun in case her worst fear was correct.
Wow, you
My dad was a cop,
But I do like the gun idea – now we just
 need someone to match it to besides you. Nothing is too far out. If she argued
 with a neighbor constantly over a barking dog, if she was forced to rebuff a
 flirty guy, whatever you got, I need. What do you know about Tommy
 O
Right! I know he called the tip line a few times.
He was accused of date-raping Amy in 2005.
She was dating him casually. There was a dinner date at his place,
 things got out of hand, and he raped her, according to my sources.
When in 2005?
May.
She never told you.
I haven
From anyone. But
especially not from Amy.
You
I can
I try never to show up to one of these meetings without new
 information for my client,
I want to show you how serious I am
 about your case. And how much you need me.
This guy could be a suspect?
Sure, why not,
He has a violent history with
 your wife.
Did he go to prison?
She dropped the charges. Didn
Now comes the harder part, Nick,
I need total
 honesty from you, it won
I cheated on Amy. I
Okay. With multiple women or just one?
No, not multiple. I
So, with one woman?
Yes, just one girl, she
Don
Woman. One woman
 who is very special to you. Is that what you were going to say?
You do know, Nick, special is actually worse than – okay. How long?
A little over a year.
Have you spoken to her since Amy went missing?
Yes, on a disposable cell phone. And in person once. Twice. But—
In person.
No one has seen us. I can swear to that. Just my sister.
And what does this—
 What
Andie.
What is her attitude about all this?
She
Say what you need to say, Nick. If she

You will need to cut off,
 completely and forever, all contact with Andie,
Immediately.

Are those—Is that all the stuff … from the credit cards?
Amy
Go, Amy bought this stuff. She
Amy
I mean, right? Holy
 fuck, right?
If she
Because she
No,
There
No.
Good. Then the question becomes …
What does she think I
That
Well, you can
You
Oh. Shit. No. It must be inside somewhere.
Don
I have to. God knows what else she
What
She
Fuck her. Open the box.
Creepy,
Stop.
That
Why bother with a treasure hunt if she was planning … her plan,
Keep me distracted, for one thing. Make me believe she still loved me.
 I
So I don
And the police would have found it strange – you would have found it
 strange – if she didn
It
 would look as if she knew she was going to disappear.
This worries me though,

Is
 this supposed to be sexual? The male has this giant wooden handle, like a
 dick. And the female is missing hers. She just has the hole.
It
So what is Amy saying?
When I first saw them, I thought: She bought children
Is she even pregnant?
You
I literally thought those exact words too. But why a male and
 female? Amy clearly isn

Amy went out of
 town a few times during the – the affair. Maybe she thought she

The climax is when you are taught the lesson that Punch never learns,
 and you are caught and charged with murder.
And Missouri has the death penalty,

Well,

Right in the noose, Andie.
You are going to put my neck right in the fucking noose.
I came to the back door,
I
 needed to see you, Nick. I told you. I told you I had to see you or talk to you
 every day, and today you disappeared. Straight to voice mail, straight to voice
mail, straight to voice mail.

Advice? Good. Is it to stop being such an asshole to me?

I know I
 keep saying that, but I do. I can
Look, Andie,
You are such a special person to me. You
I mean …
I feel so sorry, for Amy. Which is
 insane. I know I don
Well, that
We should go to the police,
I
You
No one saw or
 heard Amy after eleven p.m. the night before. The police can say I killed her
 before I saw you.
That
Look, Andie, we are both under an amazing amount of stress and
 pressure, and a lot of it is brought on by our feelings of guilt. Andie, the thing
 is, we are good people. We were attracted to each other, I think, because we
 both have similar values. Of treating people right, of doing the right thing.
 And right now we know what we are doing is wrong.
We need to end this, Andie. I think we both know that. It
And if she
That
Then! And until then, what?
What, Nick? I fuck off until then?
That
But that
I
Yeah? You know how I feel?
I feel like a dumb college girl that you started fucking
 because you were bored with your wife and I made it extremely convenient
 for you. You could go home to Amy and eat dinner with her and play around
 in your little bar that you bought with her money, and then you could meet
 me at your dying dad
Andie, you know that
What a shit you are. What kind of man are you?
Andie, please.

Hey, so I wanted you to know before you hear it anywhere,
We found Amy
What?
Yep, no cash left, but her ID, cell phone. In Hannibal, of all places. On
 the banks of the river, south of the steamboat landing. Our guess: Someone
 wanted to make it look like it
Make it look like?
It had never been fully submerged. There are fingerprints still at the
 top, near the zipper. Now sometimes fingerprints can hold on even in water,
 but … I
Sounds like you
The fingerprints we found were yours, Nick. Which isn

 shed – do not come with me, and do not go near it again. Then you
Okay, Nick, make
 your case,
Your wife orchestrated this whole thing. Make the case!
Because I
Before we start,
you have to understand one
 very key thing about Amy: She is fucking brilliant. Her brain is so busy, it
 never works on just one level. She
Fine,
So …
The second thing you need to know about Amy is, she is righteous. She
 is one of those people who is never wrong, and she loves to teach lessons,
 dole out punishment.
Right, fine, so …
Let me tell you a story, one quick story. About three years ago, we were
 driving up to Massachusetts. It was awful, road-rage traffic, and this trucker
 flipped Amy off – she wouldn
Jesus, Nick,
That
It
So, now, help me put this all together,
Amy finds out you
She picks an argument with me the night before she goes missing, and
 she does it standing near an open window so our neighbor will hear.
What was the argument?
I am a selfish asshole. Basically, the same one we always have. What
 our neighbor doesn
Okay, and the treasure hunt?
What
Those are all just bonus fuck-yous,
I know my wife, believe
 me. She knew she had to do a treasure hunt or it would look fishy. So she
 does it, and of course it has eighteen different meanings. Look at the first
 clue.
It
But Amy had no way of knowing Gilpin would be with you.
It
Clue One was part of the actual
 crime scene – so the cops would know about it – and she has the words office
 hours right in it. It
So whose panties are they?
Who knows?
I
And if the cops weren
Or no one noticed the panties?
She doesn
Okay. Clue Two,
This is Hannibal,
Amy and I visited there once, so that
And you didn
No, not yet, I was too moony about the notes Amy had written me.
 God, the girl knows me cold. She knows exactly what I want to hear. You are
 brilliant. You are witty. And how fun for her to know that she could fuck
 with my head like that still. Long-distance, even. I mean, I was … Christ, I
 was practically falling in love with her again.
And guess what?
They just found Amy
What if no one found the purse?
Doesn
She
What if Gilpin were still with Nick when he went to Hannibal?
What if Gilpin were with Nick the whole time, so he knew that
 Nick didn
Amy knows me well enough to know I
Really? How do you know that?
I just do.
Clue Three,
See, I misread this, thinking that bringing me here meant Carthage, but

Hey, wait a minute
 …
Oh, shit, here it goes,
People are hatin
Amy is just a nurturing,
motherly type of woman. She loved being a wife. And I know she would
 have been a great mother. But Nick – you just knew Nick was wrong
 somehow. Cold and aloof and really calculating – you got the feeling that he
 was definitely aware of how much money Amy had.
I found it really, really strange
 how totally unconcerned he was at the search for his wife. He was just, you
 know, chatting, passing the time. Flirting around with me, who he didn
Stucks
She was a
 sweetheart. Sweet. Heart. And Nick? He just didn
I think he
 killed her. No one will say it, but I will. He abused her, and he bullied her,
 and he finally killed her.
I hope that
That he killed her. It

 here, and I won

I mean, that makes me very, very nervous. We
Come on, you can
Nick, we
They can interpret
 this however they want. How about this one: It was Go who stole your
identity, who got those credit cards. She bought all that crap in there. Amy
 found out, there was a confrontation, Go killed Amy.
Then we get way, way ahead of all this,
We tell them about the
 woodshed, and we tell them Amy is framing me.
I think that is a bad idea in general, and right now it
Why?
Because if we go to the cops with your story, that Amy framed you—
Why do you keep saying my story, like it
Ha. Good point. If we explain to the cops how Amy is framing you, we
 have to explain why she is framing you. Why: because she found out you
 have a very pretty, very young girlfriend on the side.
Do we really have to tell them that?
Amy framed you for her murder because … she was … what, bored?
We have to give them Amy
But if we don
So what do we do?
I think the cops will laugh us out of the station if we say right now that
 Amy framed you. It
But the treasure hunt clues—

Nick, you said you were with Andie for about an hour the morning
 Amy disappeared, yes?
Yes. From about ten-thirty to right before twelve.
So where were you between seven-thirty and ten?
You
 said you left the house at seven-thirty, right? Where did you go?
Where did you go, Nick – I need to know.
It
Nick!
I just did what I do some mornings. I pretended to leave, then I drove to
 the most deserted part of our complex, and I … one of the houses there has an
 unlocked garage.
And?
And I read magazines.
Excuse me?
I read back issues of my old magazine.
Sorry, I was in the shower.
Tanner Bolt? Are you serious?
What do you mean?
I mean, Nick: Tanner Bolt, are you serious. He only represents guilty
 people.
What
Hives. Stress.

That certainly seems to be the case,
It looks like a bite
mark.

This is where it happened?

 the kitchen.

We trusted you with our daughter. We
 trusted you, Nick. Just tell us the truth!
Is it true? Did you not want the baby? Did you not love Amy
 anymore? Did you hurt her?
Marybeth, I would never—
I would never, I could never, that
Rand, tell me what I can

Say what?

Jesus Christ, I can
I can
Just

Do you believe me, that I didn
You know what I was about to say? I was about to
 say I don
Yeah?
This is Nick Dunne. You called me about my wife. Amy Dunne. Amy
 Elliott. I have to talk with you.
Call me back in ten minutes.
Okay, thanks,
Had to get to a bar. Seemed like a Scotch
 conversation.
So,
I got your messages.
Right. She
Yes.
Can I ask you what you think has happened?
To Amy?
Can I ask you why you called?
I
You
I am. I wanted to talk to you because I thought it was … interesting that
 you
Ah, you know about that,
I know there was a rape charge, but I don
Yeah.
I caught the story on the news one night. Your story. Amy
So my
 lawyer said no way I should talk to you, but … what can I say? I
Tell me,
About the assault charge. The rape.
Like I said, man, I
So do me the favor,
First of all, she dropped the charges – you know that, right?
I know. Did you do it?
Fuck you. Of course I didn
No.
Well.
Let me ask: Your marriage was
 good? Amy was happy?
You don
Meaning?
She doles out punishment,
Hard.
I mean, you should see me,
I do not look like some alpha
male rapist. I look like a twerp. I am a twerp. My goto karaoke song is “Sister
 Christian,” for crying out loud. I weep during Godfather II. Every time.

Fredo, man, yeah. Poor Fredo.

It was so fucking absurd.

So I meet Amy at a party – this is, like, seven years ago now – and

Yeah. It does.
So, I start making excuses not to hang out so much. I don
Take a drink.
Amy comes over to my place one night – I
You had sex.
Consensual sex, yes. And she leaves and everything is fine. Kiss
 goodbye at the door, the whole shebang.
Then what?

But then I was having a drink with some friends,

That
So let me tell you. About Amy. And high school. And what happened.
 Hold on.
So, freshman year. I
Yeah, I know.
Right. And pretty soon she was showing an interest in me, like, taking
 me under her wing or whatever. She had this joke that she was Amazing
 Amy, so I was her sidekick Suzy, and she started calling me Suzy, and pretty
 soon everyone else did, too. Which was fine by me. I mean, I was a little
 toadie: Get Amy a drink if she was thirsty, throw in a load of laundry if she
 needed clean underwear. Hold on.

It was just dumb stuff girls do. Back before cell phones and cyber
bullying. A way to kill time. We did prank stuff like that all the time, just
 dumb stuff. Try to one-up each other on how daring and freaky we could be.
Then what?
Then she starts distancing herself. She gets cold. And I think – I think
 that she doesn

I have to say, it
 takes a lot of courage, I think, for you to head out without a friend or some
 sort of backup. I bet you get a lot of shitty looks.
People judging everything you do without even knowing you. Like you
 with the cell phone photo at the park. I mean, you were probably like me:
 You were raised to be polite. But no one wants the real story. They just want
 to … gotcha. You know?
I
I mean, people think we were in a rocky marriage, but
 actually, right before she disappeared, she put together a treasure hunt for
 me.
This wonderful treasure hunt.
My wife, she always did a treasure hunt for our anniversary.
 One clue leads to a special place where I find the next clue, and so on. Amy
 …
Before she went missing, she hid all the clues. For this
 year.
Before she disappeared on your anniversary.
And it
Let me interview you. On camera.
Bad idea.
I
That
Too dangerous.
Say what you just said. I
Seriously, turn it off.
Help a girl out. I get the Nick Dunne interview? My career is made.
 You
What do you want to know?
Tell me about the treasure hunt. It sounds romantic. Like, quirky,
 awesome, romantic.

My wife, she

How many guys
 can say that? I married the coolest girl I ever met.

 what they

Are you okay, Nick?
The truth? No. I failed my wife so entirely. I have been so wrong. I just

I want my wife. I want her to be right
 here.
I
Like what?
Like, none of your business.
I just have a lot to make up to
 her. I wasn
So how would you make it up to her?
How will I make it up to her. First I
If you could talk to Amy right now, what would you tell her?
I love you. I will find you. I will …
Stay alive … I will find you.
I love you forever, Amy.
There she is,
The truant.

Then you
Hey, pretty lady, we come in?
I actually – I was going to come see you guys,

Home Louisiana or home Savannah?
Louisi—
It doesn

 goodbye.
You got to clear everything out; Dorothy will keep your deposit if you

I always, always shake out the sheets,
Just to make
 sure nothing is inside – a sock or underwear or what have you.
Looks like you
Got everything.
Where is it, sweetheart?
What
Your money.
Don
I have about twenty bucks.
Lie,
You pay for everything, even rent, in cash. Greta saw
 you with that big wad of money. So hand it over, and you can leave, and we
 all never have to see each other again.
I
Go ahead! My guest.
Your glasses are fake,

And your hair, the roots are coming in, and they

I talked Jeff into it.
Let me out.
Give us the money.

Holy shit,
This is like

Embezzlement.
You going to call the police, go ahead and call them,
Fuck you,
Sorry about this,
Next place you go, be more careful,
 okay? You gotta not look like a girl traveling by herself, hiding out.
You
You don
What the hell is wrong with you, Nick? I feel like I need to put one of those
 toddler leashes on you. How stupid can you be?
Have you seen all the comments online? People love it. I
You don
What if she worked for Ellen Abbott? What if she started asking you
 questions that were harder than What do you want to say to your wife, cutie
pumpkin-pie?
I trusted my instincts. I
Yeah, well, so was your wife once,
So was Andie once. How
It wasn
You
 were really, really lucky – it turned out really well, but it might not have.
You guys are really overreacting. Can we enjoy a small moment of
 good news? Just thirty seconds of good news in the past nine days? Please?
Okay, go.
Okay, thirty seconds. Did you enjoy it?
Now we need to talk. We are in a place
 where excellent timing is absolutely key.
I agree.
Gee, thanks.
I want to go to the police
 very, very soon with the contents of the woodshed. While the hoi polloi is—
—all loving on you again. Or, excuse me, not again. Finally. The
 reporters have found Go
We can
Not at all.
So we need offense,
Nick, don
Get rid of
 your hangover. You need to be on today.
It
What do we do? Let
Great, here
This is incredibly unorthodox, but
 that
Wow, that
That
So the video did help.
It gave you an interesting wrinkle: Before the video, it was clear you
 did it. Now there
Because last night it served an actual purpose: Get Amy back,
It was an offensive maneuver. Where before it would just be indulgent,
 undeserved, disingenuous emotion.
Well, keep remembering that it is serving a purpose,
Nick, I
Oh, that sounds simple,
One hundred percent canned yet totally
 genuine.
You have to be extremely careful with your wording, and we will tell
 Sharon that you won
Like a talking dog.
Sure, like a talking dog who doesn
What?
You need to tell Sharon Schieber about Andie – because it
Right when people are finally starting to like me. You want me to undo
 that?
I swear to you, Nick – how many cases have I handled? It always 
somehow, some way, always comes out. This way we have control. You tell
 her about Andie and you apologize. Apologize literally as if your life depends
 on it. You had an affair, you are a man, a weak, stupid man. But you love
 your wife, and you will make it up to her. You do the interview, it
So you already told them about Andie?
Good God, no,
I told them: We have a nice bombshell for
 you. So you do the interview, and we have about twenty-four hours. Just
 before it hits TV, we tell Boney and Gilpin about Andie and about our
 discovery in the woodshed. Oh my gosh, we
Why not tell Sharon Schieber, then? About Amy framing me?
Reason one. You come clean about Andie, you beg forgiveness, the
 nation is primed to forgive you, they
What
It
I feel sick,
Nick, it
I know, I know, it has to be done. But can you imagine, your biggest
 secret and you have to tell the world about it? I know I have to do it. And it
 works for us, ultimately, I think. It
She wants me to be publicly humiliated—
Chastened,
Humiliated makes it sound like you
 feel sorry for yourself.
—and to publicly apologize,
But it
Before we go forward, I want to be honest here,
Telling
 the police the whole story – Amy
Okay, wait, that sounds really, really bad, Tanner,
Like, bad,
 inadvisable bad.
Let me finish,
One, I think you
What do you mean?
Like I said, it
Blah blah blah, that gives me a lot of confidence,
Juries love me, Nick. I
You
Reverse that: They
Don
don
Hi, Nick, I
Don
Tanner and Betsy, we sound like we
 should be on the cover of The Official Preppy Guide, right?
Preppy Handbook,
See? He actually knows,
Okay. So, Nick,
I
Yes.
You and TV. Aside from your bar-blog thingie, the Whodunnit. com
 thingie last night, you
There was a reason I went to print journalism,
I see a camera,
 and my face freezes.
Exactly,
You look like a mortician, so stiff. I got a trick to
 fix that, though.
Booze?
That worked for me on the blog thingie.
That won
Thought we
Hold on.
Tanner?
I aim for absolute authenticity. Aside from my Georgia
 accent. And being black.
I see only Sharon Schieber before me,
Nick, there have been many discrepancies
 in this case,
To begin with,
 can you walk our audience through the day your wife went missing?
Here, Nick, you only discuss the anniversary breakfast you two had,
Since that is already out there. But you don
Yes.
Uh, as you know, it was our five-year
 anniversary, and Amy got up early and was making crepes—
What the hell?
Every time you tense up, every time you turn that handsome face into
 an undertaker
And that
It works,
It
Now start again, but linger over the crepes,
Were they
 your favorites? Or hers? And what were you doing that morning for your
 wife while she was making crepes for you?
I was sleeping.
What had you bought her for a gift?
I hadn
Oh, boy.
Then be really,
 really, really complimentary about those crepes, okay? And about what you
 were going to get her that day for a present. Because I know you were not
 coming back to that house without a present.
Definitely play up the doofus
husband stuff,
It wasn
What?
Past tense. Stop using fucking past tense about your wife.
I understand you and your wife had some bumps,
It had been a rough few years. We
Good, yes!
You both had.
We
Good, Nick, good,
Be sure to mention how close you were with your mom,
No one will pop up to
 deny that, right? No Mommy Dearest or Sonny Dearest stories out there?
No, my mom and I were very close.
Good,
Mention her a lot, then. And that you own the bar
 with your sister – always mention your sister when you mention the bar. If
 you own a bar on your own, you
Irish.
Go on.
And so it all built up—
No,
Implies building up to an explosion.
So we had gotten off track a little, but I was considering our five-year
 anniversary as a time to revive our relationship—
Recommit to our relationship,
Revive means something
 was dead.
Recommit to our relationship—
And so how does fucking a twenty-three-year-old figure in to this
 rejuvenative picture?
A little out of character, Bets.
I
So, like, what men are supposed to do in general,
And that
You need at least a little powder, Nick,
Your nose sweats when you get nervous. Nixon lost an
 election on nose sweat.
Not too
 much off that side, Go,
Bets, be very careful with that powder,
 better too little than too much.
We should have Botoxed him,
Yeah, I really need the press to get wind that I was having Botox
 treatments while my wife was missing,
Is missing.
Good catch,
Next time do it before it comes out of your
 mouth.

He came by to see me. I think he knows that he
He went to see you? When?
Last week. Before I
What did he say?
How did he seem?
He seemed like a top-drawer asshole. He wanted to pin it on me. Told
 me some insane story about how I—
What did Nick say about me?
I think he knows that he can never hurt you now that the world knows
 and cares about who you are. He
At long last.
I can
You
You would never have to deal with any of
 it.

We could leave the country if you want. Live in Spain, Italy, wherever
 you like, spend our days eating mangoes in the sun. Sleep late, play Scrabble,
 flip through books aimlessly, swim in the ocean.
And when I died, I

Amy, the police think you
No, I should be on my own for now. Can I just have a little cash from
 you?
What if I say no?
Then I

No,
Sorry, you just look like some—
We
We should leave,
Come to the lake house. I
hills are alive
You
I want to be in this situation, Amy.
Ohhhh, shit,
Oh noooo, I was actually starting to feel bad for the guy,
I have crap in my fridge older than that girl. What an asshole.
Um. My
statement is this: I did engage in an affair with Nick Dunne from April 2011
 until July of this year, when his wife, Amy Dunne, went missing. Nick was
 my professor at North Carthage Junior College, and we became friendly, and
 then the relationship became more.
I am deeply ashamed of having been involved with a married man. It
 goes against all my values. I truly believed I was in love
with Nick Dunne and that he was in love with me. He
 told me that his relationship with his wife was over and that they would be
 divorcing soon. I did not know that Amy Dunne was pregnant. I am
 cooperating with the police in their investigation in the disappearance of Amy
 Dunne, and I will do everything in my power to help.
I … I.
I am so sorry and ashamed for what I
 have done. And I want to apologize to Amy
Poor little thing,
I am a twenty-three-year-old student,
I ask only for
 some privacy to heal during this very painful time.
Good luck with that,
Poor little lamb,
She seemed terrified.
I guess he did do it after all.
Over a year he was with her.
Slimebag.
Our statement is brief, and we will take no
 questions afterward. First, thank you for the tremendous outpouring for our
 family. It seems the world loves Amy as much as we do. Amy: We miss your
 warm voice and your good humor, and your quick wit and your good heart.
 You are indeed amazing. We will return you to our family. I know we will.
 Second, we did not know that our son-in-law, Nick Dunne, was having an
 affair until this morning. He has been, since the beginning of this nightmare,
 less involved, less interested, less concerned than he should be. Giving him
 the benefit of the doubt, we attributed this behavior to shock. With our new
 knowledge, we no longer feel this way. We have withdrawn our support from
 Nick accordingly. As we move forward with the investigation, we can only
 hope that Amy comes back to us. Her story must continue. The world is
 ready for a new chapter.
Well?
What the fuck was that?
That was the bombshell. Nick was and is fully
 prepared to disclose and discuss his actions. I
You
Mike him, we do this now
I think you know in life what
I will be
 keeping a close eye on you, my friend,
You fucking did that perfectly,
You seem totally different than before. In charge but not cocky. Even
 your jaw is less … dickish.
I unclefted my chin.
Almost, yeah. See you back home.
We are in decent shape,
The thing
 with Andie, it won
The cops are here with a warrant for the woodshed … they
This is Tyler,
He grew up in Tennessee, he has a horse
 named Custard—
Custer,
Custer, and he
He
Big day, boys,
Wish you
We
Frankly, if you
 had given us the courtesy of telling us about Andie, a lot of pain could have
been forestalled. But you needed the press conference, you had to have the
 publicity. How disgusting, to put that girl up there like that.
Right,
So, the woodshed. You all want to come with me?
Come on,
Not gonna bite you.
When
I came in here very recently, when my wife
My client and I have an explosive new theory—
Oh, explosive, how exciting,
We were about to inform you—
Really? What convenient timing,
Stay there, please.
These the golf clubs you don
None of this is mine – none of this was put there by me.
That
This is,
 like, what do they call it, a man cave? A man cave in the making, just waiting
 for the wife to go away for good. Got yourself some nice pastimes, Nick.
What
I gotta hand it to you, Nick, I mean, a man has his
 needs—
Men are highly visual, that
Men are highly visual, but Nick, this shit made me blush,
It made me a little sick, too, some of it, and I don
Oh, now he
I
If we let them know we
And we give them everything, right?
We give them the clues
 and the marionettes and Amy.
As long as you let me talk,
If it
Still hot,
Supposed to get hotter overnight.
You have kids?
One.
You first,
Tell us what you got.
Sure,
Okay.
It is your contention, Nick, that you never bought or
 touched the items in the woodshed on your sister
That is correct,
Nick, your fingerprints are all over almost every item in the shed.
That
Which we have brought here today,
Nick, your fingerprints are on the porn, on the golf clubs, on the watch
 cases, and even on the TV.
You sleep
 the sleep of the damned, you know. Or the drugged.
Do you want to explain about the fingerprints?
Tell us the rest,
Recognize this?

Um, no. Amy didn
Actually, Nick, she did. She did about seven years
Okay.

 at in Brienzersee,

I had it repainted,
I know you love dusty rose.
You are so
 lovely, Desi, thank you,
I really hope you like this,
I know tulips are your favorite, but the season is so short,
So I fixed that for you. They
Tulips any day of the year,
Would Nick ever have thought of something like this for you?
Nick never even remembered I liked tulips,
My goodness, Desi,
It
Your fairy tale,
I want you to see what life can be like.
Desi, would you be able to leave me with some
 money?
You don
You have no rent to pay anymore; the house will be stocked
 with food. I can bring new clothes for you. Not that I don
I guess a little cash would just make me feel more comfortable. Should
 something happen. Should I need to get out of here quickly.
There you are,
Tell us about your wife
Illness? Amy never got sick. Once a year she
Last month you
 made Amy and yourself some drinks, sat on your back porch. She writes here
 that the drinks were impossibly sweet and describes what she thinks is an
 allergic reaction: My heart was racing, my tongue was slabbed, stuck to the
 bottom of my mouth. My legs turned to meat as Nick walked me up the stairs.
When she woke the next morning: My head ached
 and my stomach was oily, but weirder, my fingernails were light blue, and
 when I looked in the mirror, so were my lips. I didn
Is this your wife
Yes, I think so.
So does our handwriting expert.
You know what else we learned, Nick, when we showed this entry to
 our medical expert?
Poisoning,
Yeah, Nick, thank you: antifreeze poisoning,

She didn
Like you said,

The diary isn
Abuse – you pushed
 her around. Stress – you were quick to anger. Sexual relations that bordered
 on rape. She was very frightened of you at the end there. It
What a smart, convenient note for her to end on,
You look like you want to kill her again, right now,
You
You say you
 were at the beach that morning. Everyone we talk to says you hate the beach.
 You say you have no idea what all these purchases are on your maxed-out
 credit cards. Now we have a shed full of exactly those items, and they have
 your fingerprints all over them. We have a wife suffering from what sounds
 like antifreeze poisoning weeks before she disappears. I mean, come on.
Anything else of note?
We can place you in Hannibal, where your wife
We have a neighbor who overheard you two arguing
 the night before. A pregnancy you didn
We can help you right now, Nick,
Once we arrest you, we

Where did you find the diary? At Nick
Yes,
Let me guess:
 anonymous tip.
Can I ask where in the house you found it?
In the furnace. I know you thought you burned it. It caught fire, but the
 pilot light was too weak; it got smothered. So only the outer edges burned,
Extremely good luck for us.

No handle for this one.
Did there used to be a
 handle?
How should I know?
A handle like a two-by-four, very thick and heavy, with built-in
 grooves to get a really good grip?
A handle like a goddamn
 club?
I really am exhausted,

 women who threaten their masculinity,
They have such
 fragile psyches, they need that control …

But on July fifth, their seemingly perfect world came crashing in when
 Amy Elliott Dunne disappeared on their fifth wedding anniversary.

And Sharon, let me say it. Let me say it right now: I cheated. I
 disrespected my wife. I didn
What would you say to your wife, if she is possibly out there, able to
 see and hear you tonight?
I
More wine, sweetheart?
Shhhh.
Amy, you are a good-hearted woman. I know you
 are susceptible to … pleas. But everything he is saying is lies.
Nick is putting on a pageant. He wants to come off as
 a good, repentant guy. I
I know,
You
Maybe we shouldn
No, leave it on,
I have to face this. With you. I can do it with
 you.

What matters right now is what Amy is thinking. If she
Nick. You really think she can go that fast from hating you so much to
 falling in love with you again?
Go, yeah, I do. Amy was never a person with any sort of bullshit

 said she was brilliant, it wasn

You know Amy; she needs to win. She

She gave the press conference because she was pissed at you. I sorta

What would you even say to her?
I
You are definitely fucking sorry,

What if I need to

Maybe I should move in here,
Then I could be here all

 together.

and yet he tossed out my cuckoo clock

Amy! My God! My God! My darling!
You fucking bitch.
So, what
I
I made it back to you.
What is your story, Amy?
Desi,
Desi Collings took me.
 It was the morning. Of. Of our anniversary. And the doorbell rang, and I
 thought … I don
Flowers or … something,
So I didn
Oh, I found everything you left for me, Amy.
I had just found the handle to the Judy puppet – it had fallen off – I was
 holding it when I opened the door, and I tried to hit him, and we struggled,
 and he clubbed me with it. Hard. And the next thing I knew …
You had framed me for murder and disappeared.
I can explain everything, Nick.
I actually don
But I am
 going to love watching you try.
Try me now.
Go ahead, Nick. Try me now.
Okay, sure. Why was every clue of the treasure hunt hidden in a place
 where I had … relations with Andie?
I didn
So that was all … coincidence?
Those were all places that were meaningful to us,
Your office, where you reignited your passion for
 journalism.

 killed my son. My son.
How do I feel?

 for your pain.
But not my loss.
But not my loss,

What are you going to do about your daughter?
What
 is being done about Amy? Because she is lying when she says my son
 kidnapped her. She is lying. She killed him, she murdered him in his sleep,
 and no one seems to be taking this seriously.

Can I get a quote, Ms Collings?
I just gave you my quote. Amy Elliott Dunne murdered my son. It was
 not self-defense. She murdered him.
Do you have proof of that?

 husband. I want to give you the chance to be the kind of husband you want to
 be. I forgive you.
You forgive me? Amy, why did you come back? Because of what I said
 in the interviews? The videos?

Nothing made you happy. Can I put my clothes back on?

How did you set Desi up?
I found some twine in one corner of his basement. I used a steak knife
 to saw it into four pieces—
He let you keep a knife?
We were friends. You forget.

I took a wine bottle, and I abused myself with it every day, so the inside
 of my vagina looked … right. Right for a rape victim. Then today I let him
have sex with me so I had his semen, and then I slipped some sleeping pills
 into his martini.
He let you keep sleeping pills?
Right, you were friends.
Then I—
That easy, huh?
You just have to decide to do it and then do it,

 Follow through. Like anything. You never understood that.
Tell me more,

She killed him,
She killed Desi because he was basically … he
 was annoying her, he was power-playing her, and she realized she could kill
 him, and it was her way back to her old life, and she could blame everything
 on him. She murdered him, Tanner, she just told me this. She confessed.
