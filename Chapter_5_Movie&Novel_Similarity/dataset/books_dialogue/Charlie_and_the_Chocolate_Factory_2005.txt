Good
 evening, Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine, and Grandpa George
 and Grandma Georgina,
Is it really true that Wonka
True?
Of course it
And is Mr Willy Wonka really the cleverest chocolate maker in
 the world?
My dear boy,
Mr Willy Wonka is the most amazing, the most
 fantastic, the most extraordinary chocolate maker the world has ever
 seen! I thought everybody knew that!
I knew he was famous, Grandpa Joe, and I knew he was very
 clever…
Clever!
He
Absolutely true. Just as true as can be.
You mean to say I
Never,
Good heavens above! I don
Will you tell me now, Grandpa Joe, please?
I certainly will. Sit down beside me on the bed, my dear, and
 listen carefully.
Oh, what a man he is, this Mr Willy Wonka!
Did you know, for example, that he has himself invented more than
 two hundred new kinds of chocolate bars, each with a di erent
 centre, each far sweeter and creamier and more delicious than
 anything the other chocolate factories can make!
Perfectly true!
And he sends them to
 all the four corners of the earth! Isn
It is, my dear, it is. And to all the kings and presidents of the
 world as well. But it isn
But that
Of course it
It
Quite right!
Mr Wonka
 has done it.
And then again,
Mr Willy Wonka can make
 marshmallows that taste of violets, and rich caramels that change
 colour every ten seconds as you suck them, and little feathery
 sweets that melt away deliriously the moment you put them
 between your lips. He can make chewing-gum that never loses its
 taste, and sugar balloons that you can blow up to enormous sizes
 before you pop them with a pin and gobble them up. And, by a most
 secret method, he can make lovely blue birds
It makes my mouth water just thinking about it,
Mine, too,
But please go on.
Tell Charlie about that crazy Indian prince,
He
You mean Prince Pondicherry?
Completely dotty!
But very rich,
What did he do?
Listen,
and I
Prince Pondicherry wrote a letter to Mr Willy Wonka,
and asked him to come all the way out to India and build him
 a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate.
Did Mr Wonka do it, Grandpa?
He did, indeed. And what a palace it was! It had one hundred
 rooms, and everything was made of either dark or light chocolate!
 The bricks were chocolate, and the cement holding them together
 was chocolate, and the windows were chocolate, and all the walls
 and ceilings were made of chocolate, so were the carpets and the
 pictures and the furniture and the beds; and when you turned on the
 taps in the bathroom, hot chocolate came pouring out.
 ‘When it was all nished, Mr Wonka said to Prince Pondicherry,
 “I warn you, though, it won
 “Nonsense!” shouted the Prince. “I
But Mr Wonka was right, of course, because soon after this, there
 came a very hot day with a boiling sun, and the whole palace began
 to melt, and then it sank slowly to the ground, and the crazy prince,
 who was dozing in the living room at the time, woke up to nd
 himself swimming around in a huge brown sticky lake of chocolate.
Is all this really true?
Or are you pulling my leg?
It
Of course it
And I
Nobody… ever… comes… out!
Out of where?
And… nobody… ever… goes… in!
In where?
Wonka
Grandpa, what do you mean?
I mean workers, Charlie.
Workers?
All factories,
have workers streaming in and
 out of the gates in the mornings and evenings – except Wonka
Well? Have you?
I… I really don
Whenever
 I walk past the factory, the gates seem to be closed.
Exactly!
But there must be people working there…
Not people, Charlie. Not ordinary people, anyway.
Then who?
Ah-ha… That
Charlie, dear,
it
But, Mother, I must hear…
Tomorrow, my darling…
That
I
You see, Charlie,
not so very long ago there used to be
 thousands of people working in Mr Willy Wonka
But why?
Because of spies.
Spies?
Yes. All the other chocolate makers, you see, had begun to grow
 jealous of the wonderful sweets that Mr Wonka was making, and
 they started sending in spies to steal his secret recipes. The spies
 took jobs in the Wonka factory, pretending that they were ordinary
 workers, and while they were there, each one of them found out
 exactly how a certain special thing was made.
And did they go back to their own factories and tell?
They must have,
because soon after
 that, Fickelgruber
This is
 terrible! I shall be ruined! There are spies everywhere! I shall have
 to close the factory!
But he didn
Oh, yes he did. He told all the workers that he was sorry, but
 they would have to go home. Then, he shut the main gates and
 fastened them with a chain. And suddenly, Wonka
Months and months went by,
but still the
 factory remained closed. And everybody said, “Poor Mr Wonka. He
 was so nice. And he made such marvellous things. But he
Then something astonishing happened. One day, early in the
 morning, thin columns of white smoke were seen to be coming out
 of the tops of the tall chimneys of the factory! People in the town
 stopped and stared. “What
Someone’s lit
 the furnaces! Mr Wonka must be opening up again!
But no! The great iron gates were still locked and chained as
 securely as ever, and Mr Wonka was nowhere to be seen.
 ‘ “But the factory is working!” the people shouted. “Listen! You
 can hear the machines! They
But most mysterious of all,
 Charlie, were the shadows in the windows of the factory. The people
standing on the street outside could see small dark shadows moving
 about behind the frosted glass windows.
Shadows of whom?
That
 “The place is full of workers!” the people shouted. “But nobody
But there was no question at all,
that the
 factory was running. And it
But Grandpa, who,
who is Mr Wonka using to do
 all the work in the factory?
Nobody knows, Charlie.
But that
Nobody sees him any more. He never comes out. The only things
 that come out of that place are chocolates and sweets. They come
 out through a special trap door in the wall, all packed and
 addressed, and they are picked up every day by Post O ce trucks.
But Grandpa, what sort of people are they that work in there?
My dear boy,
that is one of the great
 mysteries of the chocolate-making world. We know only one thing
 about them. They are very small. The faint shadows that sometimes
 appear behind the windows, especially late at night when the lights
 are on, are those of tiny people, people no taller than my knee…
There aren
Have you heard the news?
You mean people are actually going to be allowed to go inside the
 factory?
Read us what it says – quickly!
All right,
Listen.
The man
He

And all the chocolate and sweets that you could eat for the rest
 of your life – free!
Just imagine that!

It makes me quite ill to think of it,
Nonsense!

It certainly would, Grandpa. But there isn

 who are going to nd the Golden Tickets are the ones who can

I just knew Augustus would nd a Golden Ticket,
He eats so many bars of chocolate a day
 that it was almost impossible for him not to nd one. Eating is his
 hobby, you know. That
What a revolting woman,
And what a repulsive boy,
Only four Golden Tickets left,
I wonder
 who
You see, boys,
as soon as my little girl told me that she simply had to
 have one of those Golden Tickets, I went out into the town and
 started buying up all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on.
 Thousands of them, I must have bought. Hundreds of thousands!
 Then I had them loaded on to trucks and sent directly to my own
 factory. I
Okay,
 girls,
from now on, you can stop shelling peanuts and start
 shelling the wrappers o these chocolate bars instead!
But three days went by, and we had no luck. Oh, it was terrible!
 My little Veruca got more and more upset each day, and every time
 I went home she would scream at me, “Where
I’ve got it! A Golden Ticket!
Give it to me, quick!
That
She needs a really good spanking,
I don
He spoils her,
And no good can ever come
 from spoiling a child like that, Charlie, you mark my words.
Come to bed, my darling,

It is a Wonka bar, isn

Of course it is.
Oh, wouldn

The third ticket,
the third ticket was found by a Miss Violet Beauregarde. There was
 great excitement in the Beauregarde household when our reporter
 arrived to interview the lucky young lady – cameras were clicking
 and ashbulbs were ashing and people were pushing and jostling
 and trying to get a bit closer to the famous girl. And the famous girl
 was standing on a chair in the living room waving the Golden Ticket
 madly at arm
 “I
but when I heard
 about these ticket things of Mr Wonka’s, I gave up gum and started
 on chocolate bars in the hope of striking lucky. Now, of course, I’m
 back on gum. I just adore gum. I can’t do without it. I munch it all
 day long except for a few minutes at mealtimes when I take it out
 and stick it behind my ear for safekeeping. To tell you the truth, I
 simply wouldn’t feel comfortable if I didn’t have that little wedge of
 gum to chew on every moment of the day, I really wouldn’t. My
 mother says it’s not ladylike and it looks ugly to see a girl’s jaws
 going up and down like mine do all the time, but I don’t agree. And
 who’s she to criticize, anyway, because if you ask me, I’d say that
 her jaws are going up and down almost as much as mine are just
 from yelling at me every minute of the day.
 “Now, Violet,” Mrs Beauregarde said from a far corner of the
 room where she was standing on the piano to avoid being trampled
 by the mob.
 ‘ “All right, Mother, keep your hair on!” Miss Beauregarde
 shouted. “And now,” she went on, turning to the reporters again, “it
 may interest you to know that this piece of gum I

And who got the fourth Golden Ticket?
Now, let me see,
Ah yes, here we are. The fourth Golden Ticket,
was
 found by a boy called Mike Teavee.
Another bad lot, I
Don
The Teavee household,
was crammed, like all the others, with excited visitors
 when our reporter arrived, but young Mike Teavee, the lucky
 winner, seemed extremely annoyed by the whole business. “Can
I wish you
 wouldn’t interrupt!
The nine-year-old boy was seated before an enormous television
 set, with his eyes glued to the screen, and he was watching a lm in
 which one bunch of gangsters was shooting up another bunch of
 gangsters with machine guns. Mike Teavee himself had no less than
 eighteen toy pistols of various sizes hanging from belts around his
body, and every now and again he would leap up into the air and
 re o half a dozen rounds from one or another of these weapons.
 ‘ “Quiet!” he shouted, when someone tried to ask him a question.

Greetings to you, the lucky nder of this Golden Ticket, from Mr
 Willy Wonka! I shake you warmly by the hand! Tremendous things
 are in store for you! Many wonderful surprises await you! For now, I
 do invite you to come to my factory and be my guest for one whole
 day – you and all others who are lucky enough to nd my Golden
 Tickets. I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself,
 showing you everything that there is to see, and afterwards, when it
 is time to leave, you will be escorted home by a procession of large
 trucks. These trucks, I can promise you, will be loaded with enough
 delicious eatables to last you and your entire household for many
 years. If, at any time thereafter, you should run out of supplies, you
 have only to come back to the factory and show this Golden Ticket,
 and I shall be happy to re ll your cupboard with whatever you
 want. In this way, you will be able to keep yourself supplied with
 tasty morsels for the rest of your life. But this is by no means the
 most exciting thing that will happen on the day of your visit. I am
 preparing other surprises that are even more marvellous and more
 fantastic for you and for all my beloved Golden Ticket holders 
mystic and marvellous surprises that will entrance, delight, intrigue,
 astonish, and perplex you beyond measure. In your wildest dreams
 you could not imagine that such things could happen to you! Just
 wait and see! And now, here are your instructions: the day I have
 chosen for the visit is the rst day in the month of February. On this
 day, and on no other, you must come to the factory gates at ten

Then you
And oh, what a
 terrible country it is! Nothing but thick jungles infested by the most
 dangerous beasts in the world – hornswogglers and snozzwangers
 and those terrible wicked whangdoodles. A whang-doodle would eat
 ten Oompa-Loompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a
 second helping. When I went out there, I found the little Oompa
Loompas living in tree houses. They had to live in tree houses to
 escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers and the
 snozzwangers. And they were living on green caterpillars, and the
 caterpillars tasted revolting, and the Oompa-Loompas spent every
 moment of their days climbing through the treetops looking for
 other things to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste
 better – red beetles, for instance, and eucalyptus leaves, and the
 bark of the bong-bong tree, all of them beastly, but not quite so
 beastly as the caterpillars. Poor little Oompa-Loompas! The one food
 that they longed for more than any other was the cacao bean. But
 they couldn
cacao
which grows on the cacao tree, happens to be
the thing from which all chocolate is made. You cannot make
 chocolate without the
 cacao bean. The cacao bean is chocolate. I myself use billions of
 cacao beans every week in this factory. And so, my dear children, as
 soon as I discovered that the Oompa-Loompas were crazy about this
 particular food, I climbed up to their tree-house village and poked
 my head in through the door of the tree house belonging to the
 leader of the tribe. The poor little fellow, looking thin and starved,
 was sitting there trying to eat a bowl full of mashed-up green
 caterpillars without being sick. “Look here,” I said (speaking not in
 English, of course, but in Oompa-Loompish), “look here, if you and
 all your people will come back to my country and live in my
 factory, you can have all the cacao beans you want! I
 “You really mean it?” asked the Oompa-Loompa leader, leaping
 up from his chair.
 ‘ “Of course I mean it,” I said. “And you can have chocolate as
 well. Chocolate tastes even better than cacao beans because it
The little man gave a great whoop of joy and threw his bowl of
 mashed caterpillars right out of the tree-house window. “It
Come on! Let’s go!
So I shipped them all over here, every man, woman, and child in
 the Oompa-Loompa tribe. It was easy. I smuggled them over in large
 packing cases with holes in them, and they all got here safely. They
 are wonderful workers. They all speak English now. They love
 dancing and music. They are always making up songs. I expect you
 will hear a good deal of singing today from time to time. I must
 warn you, though, that they are rather mischievous. They like jokes.
 They still wear the same kind of clothes they wore in the jungle.
 They insist upon that. The men, as you can see for yourselves across
 the river, wear only deerskins. The women wear leaves, and the
 children wear nothing at all. The women use fresh leaves every
 day…

 the shops it will change everything! It will be the end of all kitchens
 and all cooking! There will be no more shopping to do! No more

You are a
 clever girl.
Keep chewing, baby!
Keep right on

No, no, no, no, no! It isn

But I don
Put her back to what she was this instant!

and take

The Juicing Room?
What are they going

Squeeze her,

Lovely stu , lickable wallpaper!
It has pictures of fruits on it – bananas, apples, oranges, grapes,
 pineapples, strawberries, and snozzberries…
Snozzberries?
Don
The wallpaper has pictures of
 all these fruits printed on it, and when you lick the picture of a
 banana, it tastes of banana. When you lick a strawberry, it tastes of
 strawberry. And when you lick a snozzberry, it tastes just exactly
 like a snozzberry…
But what does a snozzberry taste like?
You
Speak louder next
 time. On we go! Hurry up!
Extremely useful in the winter,
Hot
 ice cream warms you up no end in freezing weather. I also make hot
 ice cubes for putting in hot drinks. Hot ice cubes make hot drinks

We shall stop in time!

Oh, those are fabulous!
They ll you with
 bubbles, and the bubbles are full of a special kind of gas, and this
 gas is so terri cally lifting that it lifts you right o the ground just
 like a balloon, and up you go until your head hits the ceiling – and
 there you stay.
But how do you come down again?
You do a burp, of course,
You do a great big
 long rude burp, and up comes the gas and down comes you! But

Go slower!
Impossible,
We should never get there in time if
 I did.
Get where?
Never you mind,
You just wait and see.
All right,
stop here for a moment and catch
 your breath, and take a peek through the glass panel of this door.

Oh look, Grandpa, look!

Crikey!
These squirrels are specially trained for getting the nuts out of

My goodness, she is a bad nut after all,
Her

Where are they taking her?
She
Down the rubbish chute.
By golly, she is going down the chute!
Then save her!
Too late,
She
But where?
What happens
 to the bad nuts? Where does the chute go to?
That particular chute,
runs directly into the
 great big main rubbish pipe which carries away all the rubbish from
 every part of the factory – all the oor sweepings and potato
 peelings and rotten cabbages and sh heads and stu like that.
Who eats sh and cabbage and potatoes in this factory, I
I do, of course,
You don
But… but… but…
where does the great big
 pipe go to in the end?
Why, to the furnace, of course,
To the
 incinerator.

But what about the great ery incinerator?

Perhaps this
 is one of the days when they let it go out. You never know… they
 might be lucky…

Walls, doors, ceiling, oor, everything is made of glass so that you

but you talk too much. Now
 then! The very rst time I saw ordinary television working, I was
 struck by a tremendous idea. “Look here!” I shouted. “If these
 people can break up a photograph into millions of pieces and send
 the pieces whizzing through the air and then put them together
 again at the other end, why can
Impossible!
You think so?
Well, watch this! I shall now
 send a bar of my very best chocolate from one end of this room to
 the other by television! Get ready, there! Bring in the chocolate!
It has to be big,
because whenever you
 send something by television, it always comes out much smaller
 than it was when it went in. Even with ordinary television, when
 you photograph a big man, he never comes out on your screen any
 taller than a pencil, does he? Here we go, then! Get ready! No, no!
 Stop! Hold everything! You there! Mike Teavee! Stand back! You

 WORLD! IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE US, TRY ONE FOR YOURSELF

Terri c!
It will change the world!
But Mr Wonka,
can you send other things through the air in the same way?
 Breakfast cereal, for instance?
Oh, my sainted aunt!
Don
But could you send it by television if you wanted to, as you do
 chocolate?
Of course I could!
And what about people?
Could you send a
 real live person from one place to another in the same way?
A person!
Are you o your rocker?
But could it be done?
Good heavens, child, I really don

No, no, no, no!

 important to talk to you about, my dear Charlie.
How I love my chocolate factory,
Do you love it too, Charlie?
Oh, yes,
I am very pleased to hear you say that,
Yes,
I am very pleased indeed to hear you say that. And now I shall tell
 you why.
You see, my dear boy, I have decided to make
 you a present of the whole place. As soon as you are old enough to
 run it, the entire factory will become yours.
It
I really am
 giving it to you. That
Giving it to him?
You must be joking.
I
But… but… why should you want to give your factory to little
 Charlie?
Listen,
I
So that is why you sent out the Golden Tickets!
Exactly!
I decided to invite ve children to the
 factory, and the one I liked best at the end of the day would be the
 winner!
But Mr Wonka,
do you really and truly
 mean that you are giving the whole of this enormous factory to little
 Charlie? After all…
