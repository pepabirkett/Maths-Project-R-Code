Damn fool,
The worst was over.
I’ll 
have plenty of time to rest when I die, but this eventuality is not yet part of my plans.
Don’t forget that I am the one who signs the death certificate.
There 
is bound to be someone driven mad by love who will give you the chance one of these 
days.
And when you do find one, observe with care,
they almost 
always have crystals in their heart.
I will speak to the Mayor later.
But if you do not find it, it does not matter,
I will take care of everything.
If it is necessary, 
I will speak to the Governor.
I understood this man was a saint,
Something even rarer,
An atheistic saint. But those are matters for 
God to decide.
If there had been a crime, this would be a good clue,
I 
know only one man capable of devising this masterful trap.
Nothing in particular,
His final instructions.
It’s the third time I’ve missed Sunday Mass since I’ve had the use of my reason,
But God understands.
The scalpel is the greatest proof of the failure of 
medicine.
In any case,
the little 
medicine we know is known only by a few doctors.
Each man is master 
of his own death, and all that we can do when the time comes is to help him die without 
fear of pain.
This is your house, Doctor,
I did not expect you so soon.
It was his wish.
It was masterful!
So then you knew!
Your duty was to report him,
I could not do that,
I loved him too much.
I will never be old.
Last night, when I left him, he was no longer of this world,
I’m sorry, but Mister 
Woodrow Wilson is coming with me.
Then it was because he did not want to.
Remember me with a rose,
this death trap of the poor.
Nothing that does not speak will come into this house,
Tell them it’s for me.
I am a man who dresses in the dark.
You left 
them in the bathroom last night.
The worst misfortune in this house is that nobody lets you sleep.
I’ve been bathing for almost a week without any soap.
Well I’ve bathed every day,
and there’s 
always been soap.
To hell with the Archbishop!
To hell with the Archbishop!
Let me stay here,
There was soap.
The toilet must 
have been invented by someone who knew nothing about men.
This stinks like a rabbit hutch.
But he was nothing more than a fugitive from Cayenne, condemned to life 
imprisonment for an atrocious crime,
Imagine, he had even eaten 
human flesh.
If you also decided to do that for 
reasons as serious as his, my duty would be to do what she did.
You don’t understand anything,
What infuriates me is not what he was or 
what he did, but the deception he practiced on all of us for so many years.
He did the right thing,
If he had told the truth, not you or that poor 
woman or anybody in this town would have loved him as much as they did.
Hurry,
We’ll be late.
La Chasse.
Death and the Maiden,
Don’t think about it anymore.
The request 
itself, it seemed to me, showed a lack of respect.
Gerontophobia,
It is a pity to still find a suicide that is not for 
love.
And worse yet,
with gold cyanide.
I will take care of it.
The man who has no memory makes one out of paper.
Royal parrot.
You scoundrel!
You’re even more of a scoundrel, Doctor.
Santísimo Sacramento!
You’ll kill yourself!
Only God knows how much I loved you.
At that age you’re half decayed while you’re still alive.
We will see each other very soon,
Fermina,
I have waited for this opportunity for more than half a century, to 
repeat to you once again my vow of eternal fidelity and everlasting love.
Get out 
of here,
And don’t show your face again for the years of life that are left to 
you.
And I hope there are very few of them.
The people one loves should take all their things with them 
when they die.
Good news.
Everything in due course.
But above all,
the first person you have to win over is not the girl but her 
aunt.
He is not going to all 
this trouble for me.
There he is,
Poor thing,
He does not dare approach you because I am with 
you, but one day he will if his intentions are serious, and then he will give you a letter.
All I ask is that you accept a letter from me,
I cannot accept it without my father’s permission.
Get it.
It is a matter of life and death.
Come back every afternoon,
and wait until I change my seat.
This is the greatest moment of my life.
Give it to me,
It’s good luck.
It is a flower of promises.
Now go,
and don’t come back until I tell you to.
Take advantage of it now, while you are young, and suffer all you can,
because these things don’t last your whole life.
It’s pure love.
These are things,
you do only for love.
It’s 
almost the same thing.
Please be so kind as to leave me alone for a moment with the young lady,
I 
have something important to tell her.
What impertinence!
There is nothing that has to do with her 
that I cannot hear.
Then I will not say anything to her,
but I warn you that you will be 
responsible for the consequences.
If you accepted the letter,
it shows a lack of courtesy not to answer 
it.
You are going to wear out your brains,
No woman is worth all 
that.
The Crowned Goddess.
What the hell do you mean, a spy?
I’m nothing but a poor 
lover.
Tell him yes,
Even if you are dying of fear, even if you are sorry later, 
because whatever you do, you will be sorry all the rest of your life if you say no.
We’ll grow old waiting,
The war is in the mountains,
For as long as I can remember, they have 
killed us in the cities with decrees, not with bullets.
Come with me, my boy,
You and I have to talk for five minutes, man to 
man.
The only thing 
worse than bad health is a bad name.
She’s a mule worth 
her weight in gold.
So I have 
come to make a request of you,
Get out of our way.
Have you spoken to her?
That doesn’t concern you,
I ask you the question,
because it seems to me that she is the 
one who has to decide.
None of that,
This is a matter for men and it will be decided by 
men.
Be that as it may, I cannot answer without knowing what she thinks. It would be a 
betrayal.
Don’t force me to shoot you,
Shoot me,
There is no greater glory than to die 
for love.
Son of a bitch!
To our death.
Neither one or the other,
I am a Spanish subject.
What luck!
Long 
live the King!
If you don’t tell me what you want me to find, I don’t know how I am going to find 
it,
I turn over to you the keys to your life,
This is not the place for a crowned goddess.
No, please,
Forget it.
Today, when I saw you, I realized that what is between us is nothing 
more than an illusion.
It’s life over there, Mother,
You turn green in Paris.
How noble this city must be,
for we have spent four hundred years 
trying to finish it off and we still have not succeeded,
He was a 
good man.
If I died now,
you would hardly remember me when you are my age.
Save that powder for when the Liberals come,
We are no 
longer in the Middle Ages.
The señorita says you cannot come in now because her papa is not at home.
You are like a new-sprung rose,
Thank you.
Thank God,
Remember that everything that 
is good, whatever its origin, comes from the Holy Spirit. Do you like music?
What is the point of that question?
Music is important for one’s health,
Doctor--wait for me there.
I told your daughter that she is like a rose.
True enough,
but one with too many thorns.
Come here and beg the Doctor’s pardon.
Hurry up.
I give you my most heartfelt apologies, sir,
Where art thou that thou art not here,
They will peck out your eyes,
It was not me,
It was the anisette.
Shit,
the dead have died.
Mother of God,
Something very strange must have happened 
for you to show up in your own house in this state.
Imagine how your mother would feel if 
she knew you were being courted by an Urbino de la Calle.
She 
would turn over in her grave.
J.U.C.
Poor man.
It is the request of someone who deserves everything he desires and whose only wish 
is to make you happy,
Do you know who that is?
All he asks is that you allow him to speak with you for five minutes,
I 
am certain your father will agree.
We saw each other twice when I was sick,
Now there is no reason for us to 
see each other again.
For any woman with a shred of sense, that man is a gift from Divine Providence,
It is yours,
I do not understand how you can lend yourself to this,
if you think that 
love is a sin.
It would be better for you to come to an understanding with me,
because 
after me comes His Grace the Archbishop, and it is a different story with him.
Let him come,
My poor child,
you are still thinking about that man.
Your father is right when he says that you are a mule,
He is ugly and sad,
but he is all love.
We are ruined,
Total ruin, so now you know.
Please get in,
I will take you wherever you want to go.
Nothing could be simpler,
Let us see who finishes first.
Now I realize,
that what bothered me was not my shoes but this wire 
cage.
Nothing could be simpler,
Take it off.
I won’t look,
What shall we do?
I am waiting,
You can look now,
I am waiting for your answer,
What a whore you are!
The telegraph is the profession of the future.
Now go and forget all about it,
This never happened.
I am happy,
because only now do I know for certain where he is when he 
is not at home.
I adore you because you made me a whore.
I prefer direct communication with God.
What do you expect, Doctor? This is the first time I have slept with a stranger.
I 
know how to do it myself.
Don’t worry,
Don’t forget that I’ve met them 
already.
I remember it very well,
and I’m still angry.
It is a 
scapular.
Harder,
I have never been able to understand how that thing works,
I see 
better with my hands.
How ugly it is, even uglier than a woman’s thing.
It is like a 
firstborn son: you spend your life working for him, sacrificing everything for him, and at 
the moment of truth he does just as he pleases.
Besides, I think it has too many things on it,
It is something that only God can do, of course, but in any event it would 
be good to have it established in theoretical terms.
Let’s not go on with the medical lesson,
No,
This is going to be a lesson in love.
If you cross that street,
when you get back here you will find me 
dead.
You have to know 
languages when you go to sell something,
But when 
you go to buy, everyone does what he must to understand you.
It’s not so much.
In 
Questa Tomba Oscura.
When I Wake Up in Glory,
shop-counter aristocracy,
No, not rich,
I am a poor man with money, which is not the same thing.
If you cannot write a business letter you will pick up the trash on the dock,
Love is the only thing that interests me,
The trouble,
is that without river navigation there is no love.
Take them and do not come back again.
You treat me as if I were just anybody.
Not at all: as if you were nobody.
Not now. I feel 
something strange, as if someone were watching us.
Not even Jonah’s wife would swallow that story.
I am 
happy to accept, but I warn you that I am crazy.
You don’t know the trouble you’ve gotten into with me,
I’m a crazy woman from the insane asylum.
They were for a love that has gone all to hell,
You made a mistake, good-looking,
I don’t do that.
Of course you do,
One can see it in your face.
The world is divided 
into those who can shit and those who cannot.
The world is divided into those who screw and those who do not.
Well, then, go back to the trolley and bring me every girl like her that you find,
With two or three more, we’ll salvage your galleon.
Make no mistake,
I will withdraw from all this whenever you wish, 
but think it over carefully.
Tell me something, lionlady of my soul,
When are we ever going to stop 
this?
Ay, Florentino Ariza,
I’ve been sitting here for ten years waiting for you to 
ask me that.
No,
I would feel as if I were going to bed with the son I never had.
I did not know that fellow 
was a poet.
I believe a 
cyclone is coming.
Coffee is poison.
Do you like music?
I like Gardel,
I see,
He is popular.
Without her I would be 
nothing.
He is a man who does many 
things, too many perhaps, but I believe that no one knows what he thinks.
That may be the reason he does so many things,
so that he will not have to 
think.
What hurts me is that he has to die,
Everybody has to die,
Yes,
but he more than anyone else.
All Chinese Are Poets.
Believe me, my heart goes out to you,
I knew because of how the flower trembled in your lapel as they opened 
the envelopes.
That is why I took off mine,
Let us go someplace where we can cry together,
You are either born knowing how, or you never know.
Spiritual love from the waist up and physical love from the waist down.
She’s a whore,
By virtue of marrying a man she does not love for money,
That’s the lowest kind of whore.
We women intuit these things.
Not now,
I’m expecting someone.
It is as if he were not a person but only a shadow.
It was your fault.
Don’t 
worry, my love, it was my fault.
Poor man.
Poor man!
A decent woman cannot have that kind of dream.
I do not believe in decent women who do not know how to play the 
piano.
To hell with a fan when the wind is 
blowing.
The problem with marriage is that it ends every night after making love, 
and it must be rebuilt every morning before breakfast.
If they don’t have more 
children it’s because they don’t fuck.
There is no law, human or divine, that this 
man has not ignored.
The problem in public life is learning to overcome terror; the problem in married 
life is learning to overcome boredom.
We’re off to conquer Flanders.
And 
whose son are you?
And tell me something, my boy,
Who am I?
Who am I now?
You are Little Roachie Martínez.
Who am I now?
How much for a pigeon?
They are not for sale.
Then 
what must I do to get one?
You drive her back to 
the coop when you find her lost in a storm.
I’ll be damned, 
he’s a man already!
The only disease my son ever had was cholera.
It’s age.
Damn it,
that all happened thirty years ago!
Anything.
This meal has been prepared without love.
This stuff tastes of window.
A man should have two wives: one to love and one to 
sew on his buttons.
The day I leave this house, you will know it is because I grew tired of 
always having a burned mouth.
Things did not go as badly for me as they would for you if 
you tried to cure the sick.
In my opinion,
the nineteenth century is passing for everyone except us.
They seem dead.
Well, it must be a very special form of cholera,
because every single corpse 
has received the coup de grace through the back of the neck.
I remember the trip very well, and what you say is accurate,
but it 
happened at least five years before you were born.
Not here, please,
Anywhere but here.
ad seen 
him, his clothes soaked through, standing in mud up to his Knees, and she brought him an 
umbrella so that he could take refuge on the terrace. In the wildest of his deliriums 
Florentino Ariza had never dreamed of such good fortune, but on that afternoon he would 
have died rather than allow Fermina Daza to see him in that condition. 
When they lived in the old city, Juvenal Urbino and his family would walk on Sundays 
from their house to the Cathedral for eight o’clock Mass, which for them was more a 
secular ceremony than a religious one. Then, when they moved, they continued to drive 
there for several years, and at times they visited with friends under the palm trees in the 
park. But when the temple of the theological seminary was built in La Manga, with a 
private beach and its own cemetery, they no longer went to the Cathedral except on very 
solemn occasions. Ignorant of these changes, Florentino Ariza waited Sunday after 
Sunday on the terrace of the Parish Café, watching the people coming out of all three 
Masses. Then he realized his mistake and went to the new church, which was fashionable 
until just a few years ago, and there, at eight o’clock sharp on four Sundays in August, he 
saw Dr. Juvenal Urbino with his children, but Fermina Daza was not with them. On one 
of those Sundays he visited the new cemetery adjacent to the church, where the residents 
of La Manga were building their sumptuous pantheons, and his heart skipped a beat when 
he discovered the most sumptuous of all in the shade of the great ceiba trees. It was 
already complete, with Gothic stained-glass windows and marble angels and gravestones 
with gold lettering for the entire family. Among them, of course, was that of Doña 
Fermina Daza de Urbino de la Calle, and next to it her husband’s, with a common 
epitaph: Together still in the peace of the Lord. 
For the rest of the year, Fermina Daza did not attend any civic or social ceremonies, not 
even the Christmas celebrations, in which she and her husband had always been 
illustrious protagonists. But her absence was most notable on the opening night of the 
opera season. During intermission, Florentino Ariza happened on a group that, beyond 
any doubt, was discussing her without mentioning her name. They said that one midnight 
the previous June someone had seen her boarding the Cunard ocean liner en route to 
Panama, and that she wore a dark veil to hide the ravages of the shameful disease that 
was consuming her. Someone asked what terrible illness would dare to attack a woman 
with so much power, and the answer he received was saturated with black bile: 
“A lady so distinguished could suffer only from consumption.
By the smell of caca.
You must have been dreaming.
Doctor.
Oui.
Look at me.
What is going on?
You know better than I,
I have no 
more love than my troupial.
In this profession we try to have the rich pay for the poor.
twisted colons,
What you want may happen, but it will not be like this.
I thought this not permitted by your ethics.
Our code of ethics supposes,
that we doctors are made of wood.
The fact I thought so does not mean you cannot do,
Just think what it mean 
for poor black woman like me to have such a famous man notice her.
I have not stopped thinking about you for an instant,
I know since I saw you in hospital, Doctor,
Black I am but not a fool.
This is the first time since I know you that I have heard you say something you should 
not have,
Well, then: I will assume it was never said.
All I 
need in life is someone who understands me.
I think I am 
going to die.
That would be best,
Then we could both have some peace.
I have a right to know who she is,
You might as well have told a snake charmer in the market,
With a mulatta.
Just as bad,
and only now I understand: it was the smell of a black 
woman.
It’s cholera.
That is true,
Even God improves His methods.
It is better to arrive in time than to be invited.
Thank you, God, thank you, how good you 
are,
My God, this is longer than sorrow!
Now go, and don’t come back until I tell you to.
If you 
come in at this hour you will have to stay forever.
He does not remember me anymore.
Behave yourself,
I realized a long time ago that you are not the man I am 
looking for.
If you ever 
hear of a big, strong fellow who raped a poor black girl from the street on Drowned 
Men’s Jetty, one October fifteenth at about half-past eleven at night, tell him where he 
can find me.
Bravo, lionlady,
We have killed the tiger.
When you’re ugly and poor, you can only want more.
Hairless wonder!
I’ll be damned!
You screw just like your dad!
And you, Señorita, feel free to carry on. I swear by my honor that I have not seen your 
face.
Orders from the head office.
This has always been a business run by people 
from the coast,
If the inlanders get hold of it, they will give it back to the 
Germans.
I am almost one hundred years old, and I have seen everything change, even the 
position of the stars in the universe, but I have not seen anything change yet in this 
country,
Here they make new constitutions, new laws, new wars every 
three months, but we are still in colonial times.
The War of a Thousand Days was lost twenty-three years ago in the war 
of ’76.
My namesake Leona 
with her worthless anarchist theories has put those ideas in your head.
If I were fifty years younger,
I would marry my namesake Leona. I 
cannot imagine a better wife.
The only frustration I carry away from this life is that of singing at so many funerals 
except my own.
addio alla vita
My heart has more rooms than a 
whorehouse.
Damn,
It must be a very big fish for them to ring the 
Cathedral bells.
It must be for Pentecost,
No,
tolling like that must be for a governor at least.
It’s for that doctor with the goatee,
What’s his name?
Oh, my dear,
I would need another fifty years to tell you about it.
Poor man, how he must have suffered!
Sanctuary for a poor orphan,
You look as if you are going to a funeral,
What an absurd way to die,
Death has no sense of the ridiculous,
above all at our 
age.
What would you do if someone proposed marriage to you, just as you are, a 
widow of your age?
Are you speaking of the Widow Urbino?
I am speaking of you.
Go make fun of your bitch of a mother, may she rest in peace.
You do that only “when 
you are looking for someone to cry with.
For once you are wrong,
My reasons tonight have more to do with singing.
Let’s sing, then,
Today we are not going to do our 
things.
I am going to marry.
That’s a lie,
Old men don’t marry.
Tell me something, lionlady of my soul,
How would you 
feel if you received a love letter written on that thing?
My God, man!
It never occurred to me.
You can’t teach 
an old dog new tricks.
Be careful, we have no rubbers.
Hello?
I was just resting my eyes.
Thank you for coming.
It is a condolence letter from 
the government.
All of them came already.
This is another one.
You don’t understand how unhappy I 
am.
Always remember that the most important 
thing in a good marriage is not happiness, but stability.
We have to 
get rid of all these trinkets; there’s no room to turn around.
It is a sin to burn this,
when so many people do not even have 
enough to eat.
Someone should invent something to do with 
things you cannot use anymore but that you still cannot throw out.
He seems to 
be a wandering succubus.
He is an honorable man, and he is the 
soul of tact.
When all 
is said and done, they also say the same sort of thing about me.
Señora,
Don Florentino is here.
I do not believe in 
God, but I am afraid of Him.
Aim, aim, got my aim-
if I miss you I’m not to blame.
It’s the heat.
You can take off your jacket,
Well, you are here now.
I beg you, let it be tomorrow,
The day after tomorrow 
at five o’clock.
Be careful, Don Floro, that looks like cholera.
The usual for me.
It is like a flying coffin.
Things have 
changed.
That will not be necessary,
The letter is mine.
Of course,
After all, letters belong to the person who writes them. Don’t 
you agree?
I do,
That is why they are the first things returned when an affair is ended.
It is a shame 
that I cannot read it, because the others have helped me a great deal.
You cannot imagine how happy I am to know that.
Come back whenever you like,
I am almost always alone.
We called each other tú before,
before.
Before, I mean, in our 
letters.
I mean,
that these letters are something very different.
Everything in the world has changed,
I have not,
Have you?
By now it does not matter,
I have just turned seventy-two.
I don’t see what sense so many visits would make,
I hadn’t thought they made any sense,
In our day it was camellias, not roses.
That is true,
but the intention was different, and you know it.
Tomorrow, at twelve-thirty, at the Social Club.
Those of us who make the rules have the greatest obligation to abide by them,
Humanity, like armies in the field, 
advances at the speed of the slowest.
Old people, with other old people, 
are not so old.
Don’t worry,
I am now four years older than she is, and have 
been since long, long before you were born.
In the society of the future,
you would have to visit the cemetery now 
to bring her and me a bouquet of arum lilies for lunch.
Don’t do this to me, Doctor,
Two months for me are like ten years for 
you.
Why do you insist on talking about what 
does not exist?
Jupiter,
Love is ridiculous at our age,
but at theirs it is revolting.
The only thing that hurts me is that I do not have the strength to give you the beating 
you deserve for being insolent and evil-minded,
But you will leave this house 
right now, and I swear to you on my mother’s grave that you will not set foot in it again 
as long as I live.
A century ago, life screwed that poor man and me because we 
were too young, and now they want to do the same thing because we are too old.
They can all go to hell,
If we widows have any advantage, it is that there is 
no one left to give us orders.
What I would like is to walk out of this house, and keep going, going, going, and 
never come back,
Take a boat,
Well, I might just do that,
You do not have to cajole me as if I were a baby,
If I go, it will be 
because I have decided to and not because the landscape is interesting.
I am 
too big to have anyone take care of me.
But we did not discuss this,
You 
too?
Do you want to be alone?
If I did, I would not have told you to come in,
It is incredible how one can be happy for so many years in the 
midst of so many squabbles, so many problems, damn it, and not really know if it was 
love or not.
Go now,
Not now,
I smell like an old woman.
We men are the miserable slaves of prejudice,
But when a woman decides to sleep with a man, there is no wall she will not 
scale, no fortress she will not destroy, no moral consideration she will not ignore at its 
very root: there is no God worth worrying about.
It is all the river we have left,
Each time I pass that bank,
I pray to God that the gringo will board my ship 
so that I can leave him behind all over again.
How awful!
The poor old couple,
The ones who were beaten to death in the boat.
How strange women are,
My God,
ships make me so crazy.
Now we stink like a henhouse.
We have orders to 
tell the passengers that they are accidental drowning victims.
Don’t worry, by the time the wood is gone there will be boats fueled by oil.
This is one of the most miserable and uncomfortable pilgrimages 
that a human being can make.
There’s no problem,
In a few years, we’ll ride the dry riverbed 
in luxury automobiles.
Love becomes greater and nobler in calamity.
If we’re going to do it, let’s do it,
but let’s do it like grownups.
Don’t look.
Because you won’t like it,
I’ve remained a virgin for you.
You have 
skin like a baby’s.
It’s dead,
Too much 
love is as bad for this as no love at all.
Leona Cassiani can 
handle those problems better than I can.
And the advantage of cargo is that it pays more and eats 
nothing,
And speaking hypothetically,
would it be possible to make a trip without 
stopping, without cargo or passengers, without coming into any port, without anything?
Well, then,
let’s do that.
I command on this ship, but you command us,
So if you are serious, give 
me the order in writing and we will leave right now.
my wild woman
The Crowned Goddess
It is going to be like dying,
Let us keep going, going, going, back to La Dorada.
Do you mean what you say?
From the moment I was born,
I have never said anything I 
did not mean.
And how long do you think we can keep up this goddamn coming and going?
Forever,
