## How to Run the Code
1. Install necessary packages, all detailed in R script files
2. Create folders for use with different R-scripts:
3. To use the function word extraction functions, need to have your novel/text from which our features are being extracted in plain text format, without chapter titles, footnotes, etc. You also need a txt file with a vector list of your function words, one  word on each line.
4. Once you have function word vectors representing each of your texts, for both MDS and supervised learning, you need to organise a folder as follows: Create a folder within which exists folders representing each of the authors being used in your analysis. Within each authors folder should be separate txt files, each a representation of the function word proportions of the text, as extracted previously using the function word extraction functions.
