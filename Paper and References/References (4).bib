abstract="Techniques for identifying the author of an unattributed document can be applied to problems in information analysis and in academic scholarship. A range of methods have been proposed in the research literature, using a variety of features and machine learning approaches, but the methods have been tested on very different data and the results cannot be compared. It is not even clear whether the differences in performance are due to feature selection or other variables. In this paper we examine the use of a large publicly available collection of newswire articles as a benchmark for comparing authorship attribution methods. To demonstrate the value of having a benchmark, we experimentally compare several recent feature-based techniques for authorship attribution, and test how well these methods perform as the volume of data is increased. We show that the benchmark is able to clearly distinguish between different approaches, and that the scalability of the best methods based on using function words features is acceptable, with only moderate decline as the difficulty of the problem is increased.",

abstract = {Several techniques have long been proposed to enhance text classification performance, such as: classifier ensembles, feature selection, the integration of similarity measures with classifiers, and meta-heuristic algorithms. The integration of similarity measures with machine learning models (ML), however, has not yet received thorough analysis for text classification. As a result, in an effort to thoroughly investigate the impact of similarity measures integration with ML models, this work makes three major contributions: (1) proposing newly-integrated models and presenting benchmarking studies for integration methodology over balanced/imbalanced datasets; (2) offering detailed analysis for dozens of integrated models that are established, and experimentally proven, to significantly outperform state-of-the-art performance. The models' construction used fourteen similarity measures, three knowledge representations (BoW, TFIDF, and Word embedding), and five models (Support Vector Machine, N-Centroid-based Classifier, Multinomial Naïve Bayesian, Convolutional Neural Network, and Artificial Neural Network); and (3) introducing significantly-effective and highly-efficient variations of these five models. The evaluation study has been conducted internally for integrated models against their baselines, and externally against the state-of-the-art models. While the internal evaluation constantly showed a total enhancement rate of 49.3% and 59% over the balanced and imbalanced datasets, respectively, the external evaluation attested to the superiority of the integrated models.}

    abstract = {Principal components analysis (PCA) has been one of the staple methods used in stylometry. In a 2021 article, Pervez Rizvi casts doubt on this method and argues that some widely cited results based on it should be set aside. In the current article, I show that none of Rizvi’s theoretical claims or experimental results stand up to examination. Rizvi argues that discarding the principal components beyond the first two makes the method unreliable, but permutation testing of PCAs shows that the top components in these trials are significant and robust, and the results across many experiments show the combination of the first and second component to be effective in classification. Rizvi argues that PCA components must be treated separately, and much of his critique of the PCA method is based on this standpoint, but this is not the practice in the work presented in the publications he cites or in the wider literature. Rizvi is unable to replicate a chart in an article by Craig, but his replication, unlike the original, does not account for the widely varying sizes of samples in his data. The current article shows that Rizvi’s claims are misguided and that using PCA in the Burrows tradition to find and formalize authorial discriminations in text samples from plays of the Shakespearean era is efficacious and robust.},
